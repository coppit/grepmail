The file test.pl contains speed tests that are not part of the test suite that
is distributed with the software because of the size of the mailboxes.
test.pl compares the speed of grepmail.old to grepmail.

Right now the tests just run the old version and the new version -- you have
to compare the results. Eventually the test script should be updated to do
comparison and error reporting if the results exceed a threshold.

The t/ directory contains the usual test script and files that come with the
distribution, as well as some large mailboxes used with the speed
testing.
