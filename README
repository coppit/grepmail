This directory contains two versions of grepmail -- one for Date::Manip and
one for Date::Parse. Please update both when necessary.

The t directory contains speed tests that are not part of the test suite that
is distributed with the software.

Right now the tests just run the old version and the new version -- you have
to compare the results. Eventually the test script should be updated to do
comparison and error reporting if the results exceed a threshold.

The speed.t script executes ~/bin/grepmail, which is assumed to be the old
version, and then executes ./grepmail in the base devel directory, using a
symbolic link. cd into the t/ directory before running the speed.t script.
