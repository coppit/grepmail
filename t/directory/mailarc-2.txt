Hi -

I'm a handy-board/ic newbie, so please excuse this question if it's answers 
seem obvious.  After two weeks of writing code in DOS/Windows (yuck), I 
downloaded the ic-2.860beta source code, which compiled without significant 
trouble in linux (redhat 5).  The version is, of course, a bit different from 
that which came with the handy-board (from Gleason Rsch, was version 2.851).

My question is, can I just copy the library files that came from Gleason Rsch. 
into the lib directory on the unix ic installation (it seems that I can, I 
just want to be sure)?  Are there any other issues I should be aware of 
(w.r.t. the beta, or using ic from unix, end-of-line conventions on library 
files, etc.).  I'm not particularly concerned with being able to download the 
pcode in unix - I do have DOS easily available...

BTW, thanks to all that have contributed to this really neat project - this is 
my first exposure to robotics, and it's been great fun so far.

Thanks everyone for sourcing information on this device.  I've got several
in hand, feedback resistors are in the mail.  Now can I get existing
OPT1210 user experience re: the following questions:

1)  I assume (dangerous I know...) that the easiest circuit (per the
Burr-Brown App Notes) is the Fig. 3 "Single Power Supply Operation"?
2)  Is 12v operation recommended?
3)  If 12v operation, did you use a 5.6v zener or lower value?
4)  Did you use electrolytics to bypass to ground pins 1 & 8?
5)  Did you build this circuit in a shielded box?
6)  Does the on-board opamp provide sufficient output to drive a set of
headphones or did you add another opamp gain circuit?  If so what low noise
device?  Any highpass filter circuits?  Is there any need for a bandpass
filter circuit to get rid of audio highs?

I am using a 3" PVC with a focusing lens (f/4") - - how did you
mechanically place the OPT210 so the focused light source falls on the
photodiode?  My approach would be trial-versus-error....

Thanks in advance....Guy N7UN/2

Joshua -

There should be no problems using the Gleason Research libraries (or
any of the libraries that are on the web site).  There are no differences
between version 2.851 and 2.860 from the point of view of the
libraries.

There is a pre-compiled version for Linux.  See

ftp://cher.media.mit.edu/pub/projects/interactive-c/unix/

yet ANOTHER idea, if you are suitably masochistic, is to use the SPI port
for a much more extensible I/O system.  As you know, SPI uses 4 basic
control signals, MOSI, MISO, CLK and SS... Ok, what we used to do in
Embedded Controllers class is hook up a Serial In/Parallel Out
(hereforward referred to as a SIPO) shift register.  You must have at
least ONE output available, so, this pretty much eliminates a L293 or, if
you are bold enough, obtain additional outputs using a '138 as outlined in
the HandyBoard FAQ.  A SIPO you might use is the 8 bit 74164.

Hook the DATA IN on the SIPO to the MOSI pin on the SPI.  Hook the
SPI's CLK output to the SIPO's clock pin.  Use a transparent latch to
update and hold the data on the outputs of the SIPO and update it with the
one output pin, perhaps a 74373.

To update the new 8 bits of data appearing at your latch's output, you load 
the SPI's data register with the byte value that you want to have across
your new outputs.  This data will be shifted out during the next 8 E-clock
cycles.  After the SPI's data register is empty indicating that the SIPO
has the output byte on it's parallel outputs, pulse the single control
output to update the latch's outputs.

With this arrangement, you could, in theory, have many, many SIPO shift
register/Latch pairs;  the Serial Data In of the next stage connected to
the last Parallel Output on the previous adjacent stage.

One would just have to make sure that you coordinated the number of stages
with the number of bytes outshifted by the SPI data register (naturally).
The downside to this arrangement is the time it takes to update a digital
output.  The entire train (8 bits, 16 bits, 24 bits... more?) Need to be
loaded and shifted out to change just ONE output.  The upside is, the data
will shift at 2 Mhz, which makes for a (250 ns * [8+2] ) 2.5 ms update
time.  Not suitable for time critical applications, (PWM, Communication)
but not bad for bulk outputs.

I don't think I have explained my little circuit here very well.. perhaps
an ASCII graphic?

Thanks David for a nice explanation of how to add I/O using shift 
registers.

Let us not all forget that the HB does have two uncommitted digital
output ASIDE from the four SPI pins:  PA7 (a bidirectional pin which
is marked as digital input #9) and PA5 (a timer output pin which is
marked as TO3 on the expansion header).

It would seem silly to disconnect a motor driver signal when these
two signals are available.
