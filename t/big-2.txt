Based on my Win95 / NT programming experience:

Yes it most certainly does!.  Any serial port needs a buffer in 
windows, to account for multiple programs that would want to use the 
port.
(ie could have 2 or terminal programs accessing the same serial pot).
Also, Windows may be busy doing something, unable to process serial 
data at that time.  Hence Windows stores input/output to the buffers 
until it can process, and direct the data to various programs.

No you either can not, or it is NOT recommended to disable the FIFO 
buffer. 
If the FIFO buffer was disabled WinNT (and Win95 to some extend) 
programs will not be able to get any serial data. This is due to 
WinNT virtualising machine I/O calls, allowing programs to 
read/write to the buffer only (not the port directly).

Can you hook up RC servo signal inputs  to the motor drivers?
It looks to be feasable as both require a pulse width modulated 
signal but I'm not sure if the motor driver's carrier frequency and 
range of pulse widths is suitable. Any ideas - it would be good is it 
can be done as it makes walking robots "easy" to construct.

Here is a good web site for hexapods that can be run from a 6811 cpu, with
schematics and the ic .c files as well, it is a handyboard/rugwarrior board
that can run 12-(14?) R.C. servos directly. simple and works well, got mine
running in one evening.

PS. I got a 68HC811e2 (2k eeprom model vs. 512 bytes) cpu and I have one
that works perfectly with the handyboard, the config i set to 0c, I ordered
12 more from motorola and they all came with a 0xFF set config register, and
the same method that i used for my first cpu doesnt work? does anyone have
any sugestions?

I really need to get these working, thanks,

I had several problems downloading from a P166 on Com2 running Win95, and
found the following solutions worked.

1.  Go to Control Panel, System, Device Manager, Ports, Com2 and select
properties.  Set for 1200 bps; 8; none; and 1.  Click the Advanced button,
leave FIFO buffers enabled, but move both sliders to the left (low).  

2.  You may (as I did) have a problem with your serial cable, especially if
you are coming from a 9-pin port.  Fred helped me with this; write me if you
need pin-mappings for these cables.

Hi all,

I managed to get the TASKING (Whitesmiths) 68HC11 optimizing C compiler, 
debugger and simulator for use with the Handyboard. Thrilled at first I now 
realize I leave the safe Interactive C path and wander of in the dark. I 
would like to get some understanding of what I am doing.

I've went through the mailing list since July 96 and have not found many 
references to using the Handyboard with a different compiler then IC. I 
have the pink book, I read the HB site and the documentation that came with 
the compiler and still can't get passed the "Hello World" stage. Can 
anybody help me with general embedded programming and programming the HB in 
particular?

My first real goal to achieve is a set of routines that use measured 
velocity (using shaft-encoders) and feed this information to the motor 
drivers. Using ANSI-C I created routines that do the actual work for the 
feed-back loop but I came to the conclusion there is much more I have to 
understand first.

I played around with the compiler package, I can create a C program and 
generate a S19 file. As far as I understand the documentation, it links a 
routine that starts up a function called main() after reset. The created 
S19 file can be downloaded without problems to the handyboard using 
HBDL.EXE. I reset the board and nothing happens!

To get some feedback during my escapades with the handyboard and to learn 
the tools I would like to start of with a routine that beeps the piezo. I 
have read the tries of German Gentile but did not find an answer. 
Programming the various timers in C leaves me clueless and implementing an 
interupt driven routine is off-limits for now. So can anybody help me 
creating (or just supply <gr>) an ANSI-C routine that beeps the piezo? 
Peeks and pokes in a simple loop will do fine for me at this point.

The compiler software I have allows for intermixing assembly and C, can map 
memory locations to variables without the need of pointers (a question of 
me earlier about this is answered in this package using a special 
identifier) and has all sorts of extravagant optimizations. I have a 
debugger, monitor and simulater, capabale of code-profiling etc. and I 
can't use any of them (yet)... ;(

I don't really understand what is happening when I download a program to 
the HandyBoard. What is a bootstrap exactly? Will the programs I write 
automatically go into the 32K RAM? What happens if I switch it off - will 
my code be unusable like IC code or can I do with simple integrety 
checking?

Since I have no feedback of the board at all I am a bit stuck...
So please, is there somebody who has previous experiences and wants to help 
me out here...?

thanks, Jaron

some of these questions are answered in the "i am using my own C
compiler/what is the memory map of the handy board" entry in the FAQ.
after reading this, please make sure you review the FAQ, because there
is more information there.

here are some key tidbits that you need to know to get going:

1.  the HB's RAM lives from $8000 to $FFFF.  It is hardware battery
backed, so if you turn the board off and on again, your program stays
there. 

2.  the reset vector for the HB is located at $BFFE-$BFFF.  you must
put the entry point for your program at that two byte location.

3.  in order to do subroutine calls you must initialize the stack
pointer.  using the zero page of internal 6811 ram is a good place.
the stack builds down, so setting it to $FF is reasonable.

4.  here is a sample program that you should be able to assemble and
download.  it will turn on the motors (mapped at address $7xxx, where
'x' is any hex digit).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
	ORG	$8000		* put the program at address $8000

START	LDS	#$FF		* init the stack pointer to $ff

	LDAA	#$F0		* put the number $F0 in the A register
	STAA	$7000		* store in the motors to turn them on.

DIE	BRA	DIE		* loop endlessly to finish.

	ORG	$BFFE		* address of RESET vector
	FDB	START		* deposit start address
---------------------------------------------------------------------

i hope this helps!

Yeah, I tried calling this number and some other numbers of
representatives I obtained about two years ago.  None of the number
worked, though.  Did they go out of business?

Hi All,

I have come across a RugWarrior board that I think has a bad uC chip.  I
don't want to pull the chip form my HB to test it just in case I'm
wrong. (turn one working and one not into two not)  My question is where
can I find another 68HC11A1FN chip and do they sell in single
quantities?

Thanks

It needs an async. serial interface with
8bit no parity. You can you the utility
posted at HB site for driving one of the
digital output to work as async. serial
interface.

sounds like my chip.
Is your config Register stuck at 0xFF like mine is?
then entire 103f register is all FF, this is how it came from motorola when
I ordered it. and I cant seem to get it to do anything other than boot with
pcbug, but without a 0c config its no good for the handyboards/rug, how do u
set this thing??

thanks,

Quinn Marshal

Jaron,

    Does the compiler provide LCD driver for HB or
    you ported the code to this compiler ?

My advice, don't waste your time, i spent about a year trying to figure that out
and never got the config register changed to anything useful, and I also
contacted motorola about 5 times and no tech person there could get it changed
either.  Spend the money on the A0 or A1, or call motorola and request a few  :)

Thanks Clancy,

but I tryed this already and without success. The hbdl loader says "Invalid
CONFIG reg (0xFF) Try again" and when I check the eeprom area with PCBUG11,
it is already there. I think, the E2 has a special protection for the CONFIG
reg.

Hi Quinn,

You are right, my CONFIG is also at 0xFF and try'd all to alter it but without
success.

Thanks

Thanks John,

but I can't believe that, it must be a way there, to alter the CONFIG register !

No I can't believe that the config register is unchangeable, because I own a
single 68hc811e2 that has a correct config, but 12 others that dont, also
these are used in the miniboard pre handyboard? with a config set at 0d, if
i remember my old board settings. There  must be a way to set these chips,
does anyone here have a miniboard or know how to set these other mcu's,??

what is so different about this chip than the a1 that its such a pain to use
the 103f register??

thanks,

I ran into the same problem. I was unable to set it with any of the
utilities for the handyboard. I ended up using my mini-board and its
download software to correctly set the register. I don't know why it
worked.

I had the same problem with an A1, in this case it was stuck at 0x0D.  hbdl
would NOT set the config, but I was able to do it with dl from Win95 run in
full MS-DOS mode.  Even this was problematical; dl would invariably hang the
computer once or twice, necessitating a complete reboot, but eventually it
worked, and I only had to make it work once.  Note that dl won't work with
the E2, you'll have to try dlm.  See the HB Tech Reference Section 4.3

This won't work, as the servo's require a one-shot, not a variable 
duty cycle type of pwm (like what comes from the motor drivers on the 
HB). ie. the width of any given pulse is not consistent, just the 
overall duty cycle. RC servo's require a consistent pulse output 
centered around 1500ms, which is the neutral position. Actually, I've 
found that with Futaba servos, the neutral pulse width is about 
1350ms.

         hope this helps, Duncan

I have assembly a handyboard the last week , and somethings is wromg, and i
can find what is the problem.
This board have a dallas backed memory , so i dont use the battery pack. The
memory can be removed and put in the place a common memory (don't backed
ram).
I try to download the code the first time using ICC11 downloader (with the
backed memory, and the bootloader go well, but when try to synchronize , a
get a error saying i expect a 0x8E and get 0x3E). I change the memory  and
put the common memory and on work well, except, when i "reboot" the board,
the code is not here (my program is gone). Actually i can't download nothing
neither backed or not backed memory. I replace the memory dor others and
nothing god happen. I check the solder junctions and all see well, I
re-solder all the junctions and nothings happen. There is some that take me
attention and don't see o.k. . The yellow led (charger led) blink every
moment. I have assembly ten handy boards , and bever happen that. I so try
to change some caps, and nothing happen. The memory have the VCC ok. I
really dont know what more i need to see. Pls help.
Thanks in advance.

Just thought I'd write a little note to everyone describing how we are
using the HB.

I've been working with Bloomington High School South in Bloomington, IN. 
About a year ago they decided to put together a Solar Bike Team to race in
the SunRayce in Overland Park, KS.  They placed 1st in their division. 
That success took them to Akita, Japan where they place 2nd overall in
their division.  A great showing. 

This year the team has added some "smarts" to the bikes.  Each bike has a
small box just in front of the handle bars that contains a HB and a second
small circuit board to interface the HB to the bike functions.  We're
monitoring things like wheel speed, motor speed, and battery current and
voltage.  With all this info we can do motor control and base that control
on the info comming in.   The HB is directly controling the motor.  I takes
the load off of the rider so he can ride.  So far it works great. The LCD
is just right to display all the info we need.  

Maybe it won't win the race this year but the kids working with it are
shure learning a lot and we should at least end up with a few style points.

My personal thanks to Fred Martin for the design and to everyone that reads
these messages and responds to them (in a positive way).  This mail list
has been quit a bit of help over the last year since we started this
project.

This years race is in Topeka, KS the end of May.  I'll let you know how we
do.

it is already there. I think, the E2 has a special protection for the CONFIG
----------

Hello ...

I'm not mastering the 68HC11 family, but I have made a project to access the
EEPROM and CONFIG register of 68HC811E2.

There is a protection in CONFIG register on every 68HC11 E family.

To access the CONFIG (programming the CONFIG), you must remove the protection
first.
Erasing/Programming the CONFIG register follows the same procedures as that used
for the EEPROM including bulk/byte/row erase.

In normal operating modes, EEPROM and CONFIG registers are protected out of
reset, and the user has 64 E clock cycles to unprotect any of blocks that will
require programming or Erasing. The 68HC811E2 and other E types family use BPROT
register (Block Protect Register) to protect the CONFIG register.

The BPROT register bits can only be cleared during the first 64 E clock cycles
after reset. Once the bit are cleared, the associated EEPROM section and/or the
CONFIG register can be programmed or erased in the normal manner.


BPROT register of M68HC811E2:

        bit 7   bit 6   bit 5   bit 4   bit 3   bit 2   bit 1   bit 0
       ______________________________________________________________
      |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
$1035 |       |       |       | PTCON | BPRT3 | BPRT2 | BPRT1 | BPRT0 | BPROT register
      |_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|


Where:

Bits 7..5    = not implemented

PTCON        = Protect CONFIG Register Bit
                1 = Programming/Erasure of CONFIG register disabled
                0 = Programming/Erasure of CONFIG register allowed

BPRT3..BPRT0 = Block Protect Bits
(see table     1 = Set bit protects a block of EEPROM against programming/erasure
  below)       0 = Cleared bit permits programming/erasure of the associated block

Hi Fred,

thanks for the answer. Oh yes I try'd all, that is possible with the
pcbug342 but without success. A very good tip comes now from Adrian Susianto
about the "64 cycles" after reset (thanks Adrian). I remember, that I read
about this in a data book years ago and I hope, this is the solution. Today
I loaded the IC 3.2 from Newton Labs and I hope the E2 will work soon (with
CONFIG at 0x0C :-)).

Good luck

Erwin

upto the $25.00 minimum order. I have not been able to find them in Mousers

i have more info to that puzzle. I assembly two mother handy. One work fine
, the other only download to a common memory, don't download to a dallas
memory !!! I don't uderstand why if work in the common memory , don't in the
backed memory? The idea is that backed memory don't have electrical
difference with the common. Maybe timming differences or something like
that??? I hear the only problem have that memory is to wait a little when
the board reset , but is solved with the great Fred addittion : the
ds1233-10 by Dallas (yes the manufacturer from the backed memory!!!) So i
really can't  get the answer. Anyone have the answer? Thanks in advance.

P.D. Chuck, i think i need your help...

Hi All,

I'm curious.  I've been watching all the stuff come through about using
a '811E2 chip in the Handyboard.  My question is: What are the
advantages of this?  I'm using E2's in my BotBoard from Marvin Green but
I moved most of my stuff to the HB because of the ease of development
and the larger memory space.  Is there an advantage of using the 2K of
EEPROM on the 'E2?

Thanks
Mike

No advanage to them (i think) because u cant use the 2k eeprom with the
handyboard in 0C config settings, its just that we have a lot of them and
would like to put em to good use.
From adrian's msg I see that setting the config must be done in the first 64
cycles, my question
is how do u do this?? what program will set this chip??could someone plz
explain just the steps we need to take to achive this,

Thanks,

Hi to all !

Here a very interesting info for all, they have problems with the CONFIG
of the "E2" (included myself). I found this at the motorola site

PROBLEMS PROGRAMMING THE CONFIG REGISTER OF THE MC68HC811E2 ON THE
MC68HC11EVM
by Janet M. Snyder

INTRODUCTION

Special considerations exist when programming the CONFIG register of the
MC68HC811E2 on the MC68HC11EVM, hereafter referred to as the EVM board.
The procedure is the same as for any other part, and the programming
will take place, but it may not show up as having changedvalues.

GENERAL INFORMATION

The monitor of the EVM board must be revision 2.5 or later. Earlier
versions of the monitor kept the chip in bootstrap mode during a read of
the CONFIG register. Versions 2.5 and later solved this problem by
reading the CONFIG register in special test mode. For reference, the
currentrevision of the monitor in the EVM board is revision 3.0.

The problem manifested itself in these earlier versions of the monitor
by showing that the contents of the CONFIG register had not changed
after programming and performing a reset. It was due to the fact that in
bootstrap mode, the value of the MC68HC811E2 forces some bits to ones,
no matter what the value that was just programmed into it. It actually
programmed correctly, but there was no way to see it. The bits that are
forced to ones in bootstrap mode are 0 (EEON), 1 (nothing), and 4, 5, 6,
and 7 (EE0, EE1, EE2, and EE3 respectively). For applications where the
security option was not included, bit 3 would also always show as a one,
and if the COP timeout was not used, that bit (bit 2)would also be a
one. So, a common scenario of the failure would be an application where
the designer wished to reprogram the CONFIG register to turn off the
EEPROM, but no matter how many times the bit was attempted to be
programmed to a zero and then reset, the CONFIG register would always
read $FF.

One of the more common problems with the somewhat larger packages
that the Dallas memories come in is pin bending. Remove the
memory and look carefully to see if one of the pins has been bent
out of shape.

If you have one Hboard where it works and one where it doesn't
you can check the signal lines for chip select and write to see
if they are functioning correctly.

Subject: CONFIG of 68HC11E2
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi to all !

Yesterday, I sent a very interesting text of a motorola application
concerning the problem with the CONFIG reg of the 68HC811E2.
Unfortunately, there is no reaction til today from anybody. This
application says, that the CONFIG of the "E2" display in the bootstrap
mode NOT the real value ("1"s instead of "0"s). Now I have a robot
controller board MRC11 (Novatronik/Mekatronix, HC11, 64kb RAM) with a
"E2" (unfortunately, I don't have another type in this time) and try to
install the IC 3.2 on it (I've ordered a Handyboard but this has a
delivery time of 2-3 weeks to Europe). The problem is, that the HBDL
loader checks the CONFIG value and read the value 0xFF instead of 0x0C
(see above). Is there a solution for this problem ? I have another
question, concerning the download of the Pcoder: when I load the in
bootstrap mode, where is this Pcode interpreter after the download ? In
bootstrap mode there is only the internal memory active (not the
external RAM) and this is too less for the loader (17kb), isn't it ?
Please can anybody explain me this process (loading of the Pcoder +
switch to Expanded multiplexed mode) ?

Thanks.

Here a second time the application note concerning the CONFIG reg of the
"E2":

AS-79 APPLICATION SNAPSHOT

PROBLEMS PROGRAMMING THE CONFIG REGISTER OF THE MC68HC811E2 ON THE
MC68HC11EVM
by Janet M. Snyder

INTRODUCTION

Special considerations exist when programming the CONFIG register of the
MC68HC811E2 on the MC68HC11EVM, hereafter referred to as the EVM board.
The procedure is the same as for any other part, and the programming
will take place, but it may not show up as having changed values.

GENERAL INFORMATION

The monitor of the EVM board must be revision 2.5 or later. Earlier
versions of the monitor kept the chip in bootstrap mode during a read of
the CONFIG register. Versions 2.5 and later solved this problem by
reading the CONFIG register in special test mode. For reference, the
currentrevision of the monitor in the EVM board is revision 3.0.

The problem manifested itself in these earlier versions of the monitor
by showing that the contents of the CONFIG register had not changed
after programming and performing a reset. It was due to the fact that in
bootstrap mode, the value of the MC68HC811E2 forces some bits to ones,
no matter what the value that was just programmed into it. It actually
programmed correctly, but there was no way to see it. The bits that are
forced to ones in bootstrap mode are 0 (EEON), 1 (nothing), and 4, 5, 6,
and 7 (EE0, EE1, EE2, and EE3 respectively). For applications where the
security option was not included, bit 3 would also always show as a one,

and if the COP timeout was not used, that bit (bit 2)would also be a
one. So, a common scenario of the failure would be an application where
the designer wished to reprogram the CONFIG register to turn off the
EEPROM, but no matter how many times the bit was attempted to be
programmed to a zero and then reset, the CONFIG register would always
read $FF.

Hello everybody,

It's been a while since my last e-mail. Thanks for all the help so far.

I've managed to connect a RadioMetrix (http://www.radiometrix.co.uk) radio
transceiver to the Handy Board. My mobile robot (using a HB) can now
communicate with a remote PC using the radio link. If someone is
interested, I will put up a page in which I describe the connections on
both sides and the protocol.

Here's a question for someone really into IC. Are single lines of code
executed atomically? For example, process 1 executes 

a += 1;

which is probably implemented something like this:

register = a
register = register + 1
a = register

Can there be a task switch between lines 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, or are these
instructions executed atomically?

Thanks.

Greetings,
Jan Sipke van der Veen

I, for one, would be very much interested to see your technique documented
on a web page.  That's a page I would definitely save for future reference.

From adrian's msg I see that setting the config must be done in the first 64
cycles, my question
is how do u do this?? what program will set this chip??could someone plz
explain just the steps we need to take to achive this,
---------

Hi..

I try to answer...

Every instruction has cycles to execute.
For example:

 LDAA has 4 cycles in Extended Addressing Mode
 LDAA has 2 cycles in Immidiate Addressing Mode

 STAA has 4 cycles in Extented Addressing Mode

 etc... (look at instruction lists from Motorola pink book)

68HC11 has some special conditions you can change before the first 64 cycles.
It means, you can change the 68HC11 special conditions (ex: CONFIG register) before the total instructions reach 64
cycles from the starting program.
After the first 64 cycles, you can't change those special conditions, even you still make it, the MCU will ignore it (it
has no effect).

And how to do this ?
Just put your instruction at the top list of your program.
Example to change the CONFIG register:

BPROT  EQU   $1035

       ORG   $0
       LDS   #$FF                               | 3 cycles
       LDAA  #$00   ;Data for clearing BPROT    | 2 cycles
       STAA  BPROT  ;Clear BPROT                | 4 cycles

The total cycles to execute the program are 9 cycles. It is still below 64 cycles, so your CONFIG register still can be
cleared.

But if you clear the CONFIG register after 64 cycles (say your program has reach 70 cycles, then you put LDAA  #$00 and
STAA  BPROT after that), the MCU will have no effect about clearing the CONFIG register.

I hope it helps..

Note that the Handyboard runs in 'special test mode' which has as a
benefit a lifting of the 64 cycle limit. Specifically you can switch in
and out of single chip mode at will, which is essential for driving the
LCD display.

Im trying to build a segmented centipede-type robot. There are several
sections, each self-locomoting, connected together by a rod that will allow
the other segment to swivel up, down, left and right by about 20 degrees
each (hypothetically).

Lets say I were to connect Ninotol (AKA muscle wire) to each of the corners
of one end of one module across to the corresponding courners of the other
module

So if I actuate all 4 pieces of ninotol, the 2 objects would be held
straight together, right? And if I were to actuate the 2 on the right the
object would be turned in a right direction, right???

If the above is true, then what would happen if  I actuiated all 4 as in the
first premise? Since it cannnot fully contract all four of them to the state
it was when I only actuated 2 of them, am I damaging the ninotol? What will
this do to the Ninotol, if anything????

Thanks for bearing with me,
Hope it wasnt too confusing
Thank you!

Does anyone know if you can call a process from within another process?
I keep getting a RUNTIME ERROR 01 when trying this.

Even calling it from a function, other than main(), gives me this error.

Thanks for any help.  :)

I emailed fred martin directly and he told me to respond to this address.

Fred:
does the sonar click indicating transmit?  pls. follow up to the HB
mail list.

My response:
yes, the sonar does click.  I have also connectd it to a scope
and both
the init and the echo signal appear to be correct.

Hello All,

I have been able to get a machine code print routine to work.
The code that will print two lines to the LCD screen follows.

Fred Martin had requested I send the code to the HandyBoard list.

Note that No interrupts have been set up.  

The Print screen routine is copied to Zero page with each 
new character printed, (to account for interrupts etc trashing zero 
page as well).

I had a few problems getting the display to work, and had to 
obtain a manual for the display.
Some problems I discovered:

1.  You need to Turn Display On first, (with an $0C code).

2.  The display in One line is so dark, the words can not be seen.
     The display thus needs to be operated in two line display.

3.  The screen buffer is bigger than the display.  Hence you need to
     write multiple characters to the end of line one, to get to line 
     two.

Generally, you can get cheaper servos from just about anywhere else than Tower
hobbies.  The cheapest, but good enough, is Hitec or Cirrus. Tower's Hitec
price is not good. Cirrus line(Hobby Shack's line) is cheaper than Hitec.
 Check www.hobbyshack.com.  Or, check model airplane magazine for other mail
order for Hitec servos.  I saw Hitec HS-300BB (standard/ball bearing) for $9.99
advertised in one of these magazines.

Local flyer from Hobby Shack advertises standard servos CS70 for $6.xx (limit
4) during the month of April. I have put them on my airplane with no problem,
yet :)

Thanks for all the (mostly personal) replies to my message. I'll put a page
up on the radio communication between the Handy Board and a PC.

At the end of the week there will be a first version up and running. It
will be accessible from http://www.cs.utwente.nl/~veenjs

Hey! We've built a play pen for our robot and plan on showing it to
everyone who wanders past our display at the Adventures in Super Computing
expo on the 22nd.  It will be vooming around the box preferably from like
7:30 to 9. My problem is that our robot will only run for about half an
hour straight.  Is there any way to make this more besides just having
like 4 or 5 handyboards with the same program in them?

BTW, the play pen looks real cool.  abou;t a 2 1/2 foot cube painted white
lined almost completly with AOL CDROMS with reflective side out.

Anthony,

A easier way to get 8K of EEPROM memory is to use Microchip Technology
25C640 Serial SPI EEPROM Memory. This is a 8 pin DIP device with a built in
SPI interface. Cost is about $3 each.  I wrote a simple application note to
connect to a HB with IC program. I had used a 25C160 (4K) device b4 the
25C640 (8K) was available. The ap note still applies though.  

The ap note can be downloaded from my web site under Design & Ideas.

I had thought about doing a design similiar to yours a while back but was
flipping through a Microchip data book and saw the 25xxxx series of SPI
memory. Was actually quite surprised when I found out how inexpensive they
were!

Hi All,

In the 3.1beta of the Mac version of IC was a board simulator.  Is this
still supported in the release version for the Mac?  Will there be a
port to the PC platforms?  I find the simulator very helpful in a lot of
situations.  But since I do my development on the PC now (sigh), I find
it a pain to get my files to the Mac.  Once it's there it's a breeze,
just a couple of global search and replaces and I'm off.

Thanks
Mike

I just bought the motor driver kit from wirz electronics, and I have
finished putting it all together. My question is, do I take the motor
drivers off of the HB and put them on the wirz board, or do I leave them on
the HB.

Question 2:  Assuming I have figured out #1(see above) where do I connect
the wirz board to?  Should I be using the servo routines, or does it plug
in where the motor drivers on the HB go?

Thanks everyone,
Mike

<FontFamily><param>Courier New</param>We've used the Wirz boards with great success here at Washington University. 
 I can answer both of your questions at once, since they're the same thing.




YES.  Take the drivers off the handyboard, because now the wirz boards will 
connect to those sockets.  If you have the bridged 18200 board, then each 
socket can control 2 boards.  If you have the non-bridged version (ie, the wirz 
board will control 2 motors independently) then each socket connects to two 
boards.




Here's how the pinnouts go for the non-bridged version:




Wirz Board Connector: 		L293D Pin:

---------------------------------------------------------
--------

3 (M1 PWM)			1 (Chip Select 1)

4 (M2 PWM)			9 (Chip Select 2)

5 (M1 Brake)		No Equivalent (Use a digital 	
					output to brake the motor, 
					or tie it low)

6 (M2 Brake)		same

7 (M1 Direction)		2 (input 1, dont need in2)

8 (M2 Direction)		10 (input 3, dont need in4)

9 (M1 Thermal)		none (goes high when chip

						overheats)

10 (M2 Thermal)		same

11 (M1 Current)		Analog signal of current draw

12 (M2 Current)		same




	If you have the bridged 18200 board, then for each 
motor use a single board per motor.  In the bridged 
version the M1,M2 pins are connected, so use whichever 
ones you want.  Just connect the first board to the M1 
L293 equivalents and the second to the M2 equivalent 
pins.




	Hope this helps!!!

Oh yeah, just use the regular motor IC routines.  Plug and play!

I think I am a little confused by the wording of this.  I am using the
non-bridged board, so 1 socket on the HB controls how many boards? 


Thanks for all your help.  Really appreciate it!

With the non-bridged board, each socket will control 2 boards.

So for board 1, you'll connect to pins 1 and 2 in the socket, and for board 2 
connect to pins 9 and 10.  The other pins you can do as you please (for the 
brake, current sense, and thermal sense)

CRAPOLA!  NEVERMIND!  I was wrong and thinking of the bridged version (the one I use here. . .)
SORRY, MY BAD.

	Each socket on the handyboard will control 1 (ONE, UNO, UN. . .) 
Wirz _non-bridged_ 18200 board.  Since the non-bridged version can control 2 
motors, this give you 4 motors total.  Sorry about the confusion.  You can wire 
them up exactly as I specified in my first email.

What exactly is a yacc stack overflow?  I wrote somemore code to my nifty
lil program involving adding more else if statements and it wont let me
compile.  Does anyone know what a yacc stack over flow is?  How do I fix
this so it will compile my program?
Thanks!

Subject: CONFIG reg of "E2"
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi to all !

Last week, I sent a interesting text of a motorola application (found at
http://www.mcu.motsps.com/lit/faq/as-79.htm), concerning the problem
with the CONFIG reg of the 68HC811E2, unfortunately, there is no
reaction til today. This application says, that the CONFIG of the "E2"
displays in the bootstrap mode NOT the real value ("1"s instead of
"0"s). The problem is, that the HBDL loader checks the CONFIG value and
read the value 0xFF instead of 0x0C (see above). Is there a solution for
this problem ?

Thanks.

Erwin

Hi all,

Anyone in the southern New England area will be interested in the Rhode 
Island School of the Future's annual "Robotic Park" exhibition of kids' 
robotic creations, to be held Saturday, May 2, 1998 at the Peace Dale 
Elementary School in Wakefield, Rhode Island.

I've worked with a number of the teachers who are involved in the this 
project, and it's a really great group of teachers who inspire their kids 
to create some awesome robotics projects.  A number of the teachers are 
using our MIT Programmable Bricks (the project that led to LEGO's 
recently-announced Mindstorms Robotics Invention System).

The location is about 1 hour 45 mins drive from the Boston area.  The 
basic route is take 95 through Providence, get onto route 4 South (a 
left-hand exit off the highway), then route 1 west.  Several miles after 
getting onto route 1, look for a Holiday Inn on the right hand side, and 
take the right hand turn there.  About a mile later, there is a traffic 
light with a left hand turn onto rt 108.  Take that; after a couple more 
mi, Kersey Road will wind away from the road as a left just before a 
sharp right hand bend in the road.  There's a lawn equipment rental place 
at this juncture.  The Peace Dale school is immediately on the left when 
you turn onto Kersey Road.

Hope to see you there!  See enclosed for more info.  I've also attached a 
set of maps from MapQuest to help you get there.

Fred

    PLEASE HELP SAVE THE GIANT PANDAS

Patches,  the panda, making no sound at all, wanders slowly through the 
misty mysterious Chinese Mountains.  She is searching for a beautiful, 
tasty bamboo forest in which she will eat bamboo shoots and leaves. 
Except, to Patches surprise, there is not enough bamboo for her to eat. 
For this reason she is sad.  If you help save the bamboo forest you will 
help save the pandas of China from starving to death.

                              CHICO THE WOLF
One dark Arizona night a wolf named Chico was hunting for rabbits. When 
he sees his prey his eyes will blink like a bright moon. He will chase 
the rabbit. Chico the wolf can run faster than a horse.  When Chico 
catches his prey he will take his food to his den, where he will eat it.  
Then Chico will go out hunting again.


                             ELMO THE ELEPHANT
Elmo, the African elephant, lives in the Congo River Basin.  Elmo runs 
through the jungle in search of leaves to eat and ponds to get a drink 
from.  He is running home, blinking his eyes and moving his trunk up and 
down.  Elmo, is one of the last elephants in the world because elephants 
are hunted and killed for their valuable white ivory tusks.


                       GEORGE THE GIANT GALAPAGOS TURTLE George, the 
giant Galapagos turtle, lives on the Galapagos Islands.  He roams 
throught the trees looking for leaves to eat.  He is  also looking for 
friends so his species will never end.  George has a major problem, he is 
the last Giant Galapagos Turtle living on the Galapagos Islands.  He 
cannot find a mate and therefore the Giant Galapagos Turtles will become 
extinct.

I obtained a V2X from Jameco. I don't know if they have the sonar units.

After driving all my robots with step motors, I finally decided to try
driving one with DC motors.  I got a couple of the lego gearmotors, and
mounted them on my robot with belts driving the wheels at a reduction ratio
of about 1.5:1, and have been doing some experimenting with the different
speeds.  
I am very surprised at the lack of change between speed 11 (which is the
slowest speed that will actually make the motor turn), and speed 100.  As
near as I can tell there is an 18 rpm difference between speed 11 and speed
100.  The difference is so small that I can't see any difference when I run
my robot across the floor at any speed.  (given that speed 11 results in
183 rpm at the wheel, that is less than a 1% change!)
Has this been the case with any of you?  Am I doing something wrong?  I
don't want to have to go back to step motors!  Please email me with your
experiences!

Note: I am using IC 3.2, but I don't know if the new 'smooth pwm routines'
are in there.  Anybody know how I can tell?  and if they're not, how do I
implement them?

thanks for any insight you can give me.

yup, here's what's going on.  the motor percent argument controls the
POWER, not the speed.  if the motor is essentially unloaded, it will
run at nearly full speed even at a low power percentage.

if you build a gear train that makes the motor do some real work (like
carry around the handy board), then you should see a pronounced speed
difference as a result of the different power levels.

I wonder if any of you have had this problem before, but 
when I try to download the pcode_hb.s19 to the handyboard, 
it seems to download okay....however, when I power-cycle the 
board, it still acts if I didn't download anything - LCD is 
blank, buzzer doesn't have any sound etc. Is it a problem 
with my HC11? (Because I already tried a new RAM 
chip) Even in DOS when I try to load the config0c.s19 file 
to it, it repeatedly tells me that "expected 0c, got 
*something* at *somewhere*" even though I already did all 
the necessary steps. As a result of this, my board is still 
1/8 assembled.... :(

Hi All,

I currenty have the Sonar connected to my Handyboard and it is great. I am
interested in purchasing the Vector compass. Has anyone got both working
together, it seems they both use the same SPI ports or the same pin 2 on
the motor chip.

Any info would be great

Thanks
Michael

Does anybody know if it's possible to make a pin high and then leave it
high until I send another command to make it low?  or will I have to set up
some sort of external bistable flip flop that will save the state?

I assume I would have to use some assembly language statements embedded in
my C program- right?
any ideas on how I can make this happen using one of the unused pins on my
handyboard?  

By the way: thanks for everyone's replies on my 'DC motor blues'.

You mean SPI outputs?
Yes, check the HB HP FAQ under something like...

CLANCY,

It is the Serial Periperal Interface
Handles Serial Data transmission out/in the 68HC11.

I.E.the Handy Board uses an SPI for downloading data from the

Subject: Smooth PWM in IC 3.1?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I apologize for asking a question I think I've seen answered,
but I can't find it in the mail archives.

Is it possible to use Julian Skidmore's smooth PWM routines with
Newton Labs' commercial IC 3.1?  Since they use a different version
of pcode.s19 than the freeware IC, I assume the smooth-PWM modifications
would have to be applied to that, and I haven't found a way of doing
so.

Thanks

What Hacker said, but also, there's a 2x4 female SPI header on the HB just
above the power jack that allows you to hook up other serial devices to the
HB (like other HB's, memory, etc.)  It's shown in the HB Tech. Reference and
there are examples on the HB web site from people who have used the serial
I/O capability in their IC programs.

but this is not.  the Handy Board communicates with the desktop

The SPI is for high speed (up to 1 megabaud) sychronous (i.e.,
separate clock signal) transfer to specialized peripherals.

Yes, it is possible.  It must be, 'cause I've been doing it.

You simply need to download Julian's pcode_hb.s19 (rename your other one
first) and put it in the IC31\libs directory (or whatever you call it).  IC
3.1 ought to automatically load it instead of the original version.  You'll
know when you've got it, because IC will give you a warning that you're
using an out-of-date pcode (due to the old version number in Julian's pcode).

BTW, no apologies are necessary.  Everyone on the list is more than happy to
help, I'm sure.  Good luck, Ken.

Does your while loop have a break(); statement. I have an idea that this may be necessary in some situations.

Does anyone know if you can call a process from within another process?
I keep getting a RUNTIME ERROR 01 when trying this.

Even calling it from a function, other than main(), gives me this error.

Thanks for any help.  :)

Correction:  You'll also need Julian's lib_hb.c to go with it.  Again,
rename your current version first so you don't overwrite it.  Put the new
one in the libs directory where the old one was, and load it (or let it be
automatically loaded).  Along with his pcode_hb.s19, that ought to do it.

I hope I haven't left anything else out :)

Subject: 16 digital outputs as Fred suggested
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi guys,
I needed 16 digital outputs for my handyboard, so I put up a very simple
expansion board the way Fred suggested in his handboard FAQ: I connected
two more hc374 with their d-inputs to LCD-display's data bus (d0 - d7).
Then I connected the first hc374's clock to y4 and the second one's to
y5. Really simple, indeed. Now I would like to use those outputs with
Interactive C.
I figured, if I want to set output 0 to 6 low and output 7 high then I
have to put 0+0+0+0+0+0+0+2^7=128 on the bus. Then I have to pulse y4
low
for a short time for hc374 to put the bus word through to its Q outputs. 
In HB Technical Reference (chapter 11 Pin out Detail), Brian Schmalz
suggests to pulse y4 low for 1 cycle by the command WRITE 0x6000  
So that's all I know.
Now my question:
Could you tell me the IC code to operate those outputs using IC?
I hope, somebody out there has solved this problem before.

I duno... I fergot. Sorry.  :(  It was a long time ago (milage-wise). I
didn't use that method of mutitaking anymore and I didn't save the old
code.

But, I don't think so, I can't imagine that would be my style.  I would
set a global variable from within the process and kill the process in
main() when the variable is set. (i.e. if(end_process1 = 1) kill(pid1);)

It was kinda baffling why it did that though.  Anyway, If I ever
recreate the error, I'll let you know.

Thanx.  :)

Subject: >1A adapter?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello folks,

I am currently using the HB to control a robot tethered to a PC (via the
serial/charger board), as I'm using genetic algorithms to evolve
controllers.  The robot pulls about an amp (with motors, servo, sonar
etc.), and I'm running it off a 12v (3.6Ah) lead-acid battery. I don't
use the serial/charger board to charge it, but instead just stick a
car-battery charger on the battery terminals every now and then.

As this charging is time-consuming, I'm thinking why not just run power
down the tether and take the batteries out of the loop entirely for the
training phase.  So I have two questions:

1. We are warned not to use high-current adapters, as "problems have
been reported."  What problems, specifically?  I am thinking a 12v, 1.5A
adapter would suit me fine, but I'm not keen on a flaming HB.

2. If this *is* possible, the 12v adapter won't have enough juice to
charge the 12v battery, so should I unhook the battery completely or
just leave it in there?

Cheers, Skye.

Hi, when I compile fencdr0.asm, I get

"xxxjunk.c"(68): Warning --- Value Truncated
"xxxjunk.c"(70): Warning --- Value Truncated
"xxxjunk.c"(68): Warning --- Value Truncated
"xxxjunk.c"(70): Warning --- Value Truncated

Does everyone else get this too?
Apparently, these are only warnings and it compiles but what does this
mean?  Is it dangerous to use the program?

Hello:   =20
I have a V2x compass and I was trying to hook it into my handyboard =
using Tom Brusehaver's .icb, .c and instructions as described in the
contributed section.

I have also grounded the M/S pin on the compass.  The EOC
pin is sent to the HB thru the npn transistor.

All this is discussed in the mail archive and in Tom's
description.  I still can't get the compass to work.
With V2x(), I get a constant heading of 0.
I changed the value of the global head_word to 10 and then
10 appears constantly on the LCD.  Does this mean, I am
not getting any SPI interrupts?  I don't have a logic probe,
but I did reset the Compass by grounding the reset pin for
a moment after running comp_disable(1).  There are no
improvements.
I checked the eoc line - it always reads .76 V, the SS line
(through the transistor, at its collector) reads .1 - .2 V.
I don't know if the compass is sending out any clock signals.
What am I doing wrong?  Do I have a bad compass?
Thanks for your help.
Regards,
...Ameen Suleman

1.  please read the Appendix B documentation in

http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/techdocs/

which explains this in more detail than the FAQ.

2.  you must the even-numbered Yx signals for output latches.  Since
Y6 is taken (by the on-board latch for the motor drivers), you're left
with Y0, Y2, and Y4.

3.  To set the bits in a latch connected to Y0, all you do is write a
byte anywhere in the 0x4??? memory range; e.g., "poke(0x4000, 0x55)"
sets every other bit.  That's all there is to it.

Hi Armeen,
I have the same problem as you. I thought my HB was faulty or it doesn't
work with the 68hc11E processor I use or something.
So what I did was: I wrote a very simple IC-Routine. You have to load
this program with "load v2x.c" and call the routine with "v2x();"
It is very basic but it has one advantage: it works ;) !!

This is how to connect the V2X to HB (referring to Tom's diagram):

V2X		HB

GND		GND of SPI
+5V		+5V of SPI
SS		SCK/PD4 of SPI
P/C		MISO/PD2 of SPI
SCLK		MOSI/PD3 of SPI
SDO		Digital input #7

Save this following program under v2x.c:
/* HB V2X-commands */
/* Alf Kuchenbuch 1/1998 */
/* SS=16=yellow; SCLK=8=green; PC=4=orange;;; SDO=blue=dig7 */ 
int head=0;
int v2x()
{
	int dat[18];
	int i;
	poke (0x1009,0x3c);
	/*request*/
	poke (0x1008,8+16);
	sleep(.1);
	poke (0x1008,4+8+16);
	sleep(.1);
	poke (0x1008,4+8);
	for (i=0; i<16 ;i++)
	{
	sleep(.0001);   
	poke (0x1008,4);
	poke (0x1008,4+8);
	dat[i]=1-digital(7);
	}
	poke (0x1008,4+8+16);
head=-1+dat[15]+dat[14]*2+dat[13]*4+dat[12]*8+dat[11]*16+dat[10]*32+dat[9]*64+dat[8]*128+dat[7]*256;
	printf("Heading: %d\n",head);
	return head;
}


Hopefully someone has solved the problem so we can use Tom's routines
soon!

Question.   I've been playin with the servo routines available from the HB
page.  One thing I've noticed.  The servo's seem to chatter a lot.  Is this
normal.  A routine that  does nothing but loop, read the knob and output a
value based on the knob to the sevo works well but the servos chatter. 
Even when the knob is not changing the servo is not still.  There are no
other routines running.  Just the IC3.2 stuff with this short loop.

can you ascertain whether the knob is returning the same value every
time through the loop?  i wasn't clear if "even when the knob is not
changing" meant just that you weren't turning the knob, or whether you
were sure it was always producing the same value.

When I see the servo chatter, the knob is returning the same value.  In
fact I can just set a constant unchanging value without using the knob and
get the chatter.  

I've tried this on two HB's and get the same results.  The servos are small
Futabas.

Hold down the START button while powering on.  This will prevent the
board from running main().

 Try turning off the board and holding down the start button while
re-powering the board.  Hope it works for you.

Mar,

I ran into these warnings when I was modifying sencdr0.asm.
They do in fact show a bug in the assembly code, but it's
harmless.  If you like gory details, here they are:

Near the beginning, the file defines these constants:
BASE	EQU	$1000
ADCTL	EQU	$1030	; A/D Control/status Register

BASE is the base address of the block of Handy Board registers;
ADCTL is the address of the A/D control register.

Later, to clear this register, the code does this:
LDX		#BASE
LDAA	#0
STAA	ADCTL,X

This loads the X index register with the base address and the A
register with zero, then stores the A register into an address which
is offset from the value of the X register.  The programmer gives
ADCTL as that offset, *but the instruction only allows a one-byte
offset.*  So instead of storing into $2030 (1000+1030), which is
what was asked for, the assembler truncates the offset to one byte
($30) and stores into $1030, which is what is wanted.

You can safely remove the upper byte from ADCTL (and ADR1), or you
can leave well enough alone and live with the warnings, as I did.

Hello all, I'll just briefly restate my earlier questions for ease of
responding:

1. Why are we encouraged not to use big adapters (>1A) for the HB?  Is
   it because of the charging circuit, or does it fry the board?

2. Can I plug a big adapter into the charging board, set it to Zap mode,
   and just use it to drive my tethered robot instead of batteries? 
   (i.e. remove the batteries entirely)

Cheers, Skye.

I have noticed in my experiments that the HB servo routines don't
interact well with the LCD. In order to get them to work reliably
in my Handyboard library I redesigned the way the LCD driver
worked. Unfortunately for you that library was built for icc11,
not IC so it won't help you.

However, if someone else wants to fix this for the general case,
here are the steps.

1) In my case the problem arose because the LCD driver does a
busy loop waiting for the LCD to be done before it writes a
character. Depending on where in the cycle you 'hit' it, you can
wait anywhere from 0 to 1mS. 

2) The servos get to run when their controlling timer interrupts,
however, because the LCD driver has to run in single chip mode,
it is required to disable interrupts for its duration.

I made things better in my driver by rewriting the LCD driver to
be asynchronous. Basically the lcd_write routine queues a
character to the LCD and then during system ticks the LCD driver
checks the queue, and if it is non-empty, attempts to write one
character. The magic is that if the LCD is busy it just returns
immediately, assuming it will pick up the character on the next
systick. That made the interrupt response time to the servos MUCH
more predictable and I could run three with no chatter at all.
The down side is that sometimes you will may wait nearly 2ms to
write to the LCD however that is still a rate of 480 characters
per second so its still more than too fast for humans.

because if you put it into zap mode, you'll fry your batteries --
unless you've switched to a much higher amperage pack.

no, because you can't send that much current down the RJ11 cable.
unless your robot draws very little power even when motors are on;
i.e., less than 500 mA or so.

      Hi all, Futaba servo's chatter when the pulses are not updated 
quickly enough. At best, this produces a slight buzz, at worst they 
'hunt and seek' their position a tiny bit. I don't know how fast the 
HB routines update the pulse, but standard Futaba receivers send the 
pulses about 60/sec. You can get decent performance from the servo at 
20/sec. I haven't used servos with the HB, but I have used them 
extensively with PIC's. Perhaps this is causing the problem?

Hey. I just got a couple more handyboards and both of them had exactly no
power in them.  Ive let one charge for about 12 hours and then tried to
use the Initialization app on it and it wont synchronize with the board.
Does anybody know what im doing wrong?  I tried holding down the start
button and everything and used differnt ports and computers, but i have no
idea.  Can anyone help me out?

Nevermind my last message.  I had a phone cable that was dodge.
Out of curiousity...Is anyone on this list familiar enough with C to make
a program that you could input wheel diameter and wheel base along with
the weight of the robot and reference your code and have a robot
simulator?
Just to kind of test stuff out before putting it in the handyboard.

Subject: Handyboard simulator

Hey, I was wondering whether anyone knew of a Handyboard simulator.  I am
working on a group project where each person develops code in C using IC for
the Handyboard.  The problem is that we have only one handyboard and thus
only one person is able to compile and test their code at a time.  This is
very inconvinient as we are in physically different locations.  Is there a
simulator which will compile your C code and then show a realtime ouput of
the different motor ports while simultaneously reading the digital and
analog input ports and running your code.  Is there perhaps a retail package
or something in the works?  If not, how hard would it be to create one.
Thanks in advance for any help.

Hello everybody,

We tried to link two Handy Board, via the RJ11 computer connectors, in =
order to make them communicate with the code we found at =
http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rsargent/ic/serialio.html .
But, when we plugged the cable, the Handy Boards began to smoke next to =
these connectors.
Does anybody know how we could link our two Handy Boards ?
If someone know how, please send us the schemes and (if possible) the C =
code to have them communicate. :)

Thanks a lot in advance. :)
OM99 & RC99

Hope the force will be with you !!!!!

I'm still problems with two boards. I'm still can download code , but never
"boot". That code work in all others board.I can't make run off course, IC.
My answer is : The downloader check every byte it download to the board from
the memory??? Or check from the serial register?
I can't understand how the downloader say "the code is downloaded" and the
that code is not here. Anyway, pls, if any have a idea or something I can
see....
Thanks

Yeah, because if you see the cable, you are swapping the VCC and GND betw=
een
the boards, you know , one board is right , but the other is getting the =
12V
to GND and "viceversa".
>Does anybody know how we could link our two Handy Boards ?
You are not taking the best way. the better way is connect using the SPI
(The boards are near or far?) I haven't code for ths SPI comuncattion, bu=
t
you can see th pink book (available at mototrola site for free), and i'm
sure you don't have problem.

The code found at
http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rsargent/ic/serialio.html was intended
for connecting a Handy Board to the host PC.

It is possible to connect two Handy Boards, but you must use a NETWORK
style RJ11 cable, rather than the usual TELEPHONE style RJ11.

See the FAQ, under entry "The R11 on my Interface/Charger board is
smoking hot and is turning black! What is wrong?" for more info on
RJ11 cables.

Hello, I wonder if anyone knows if I can expand the Handyboard's memory
to the maximum of 64KB simply be wiring in a 128kb SRAM (A16 unused so
it becomes 64kb) with D0-D7 to the data bus as usual and A0-A14 to the
existing RAM socket and A15 from the expansion header directly to the
RAM's A15? Would IC need any modification or anything? Thanks!

This is a common question, so I went ahead and put an answer in the
FAQ.  Take a look at:

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/faq/index.html#moremem

Here's what it now says:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
    IS IT POSSIBLE TO EXPAND THE HANDY BOARD'S MEMORY TO 64K?
    
    Actually, this is hard to do. Here's why:
    
    1.There is a compromise in the design that traded off a wasteful use
    of the lower 32K of memory for fewer chips used in creating the motor
    output, digital input, and expansion bus circuits. Basically, 16K of
    the lower 32K is used to map four input latches and four output
    latches to the microprocessor (see more info in the memory map
    answer).
    
    What this means is that in order to recapture the lower 32K, the
    addressing circuit that drives the 'HC138 chip (which then drives
    these latches) would need to be modified. Presently, the 'HC138 is
    wired to the 68HC11, using the A15, A14, A13, and A12 signals. To
    recapture the address space, many more address signals would need to
    be combined to force the HC138 to enable itself only when a narrow
    band of addresses were accessed. Then, an additional RAM could be
    mapped to the lower 32K bank not used by this remapped 'HC138 circuit.
    
    2.Interactive C
    would need to be recompiled. Interactive C was designed with certain
    assumptions about the architecture of the target system; one of those
    included a 32K RAM. Various modifications to Interactive C (largely,
    the redefining of compile-time constants) would be necessary for it to
    use a different memory architecture.
    
    This said, it is relatively straightforward to build a 
    serially-accessible external memory for data storage. For example, see
    Jim Fong's SPI-based EEPROM application note.

Subject: Handyboard simulator

Hello, I was wondering whether anyone knew of a Handyboard simulator.  I am
working on a group project where each person develops code in C using IC for
the Handyboard.  The problem is that we have only one handyboard and thus
only one person is able to compile and test their code at a time.  This is
very inconvinient as we are in physically different locations.  Is there a
simulator which will compile your C code and then show a realtime ouput of
the different motor ports while simultaneously reading the digital and
analog input ports and running your code.  Is there perhaps a retail package
or something in the works?  If not, how hard would it be to create one.
Thanks in advance for any help.

1. The freeware version of IC had a command ('mem' if me recollection is
correct) that returned the amount of free memory in the HB, but that
command doesn't seem to be available in the most recent commercial version.
 is there some other command that I can use to perform this function?

2. Is there a way I can re-synchronize the handyboard with IC without
exiting and restarting IC?  (does this happen automatically when I hold
down the 'start' button when I turn on the HB?)

Subject: Miniboard, ICC11, and printf
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I have a miniboard and I am using the free version of ICC to program it. I
did replace the standard crt.s with the one for the miniboard, but I am
unable to get printf to work. Actually, I am unable to download programs
that use printf. The sample dhry.c will not download to the miniboard. I
did create a simple program to print "hello" and that did download, but
nothing showed up on the terminal screen. I also tried the printdec
command. I did get this to print a blank space, but it was not followed by
crlf, and the data was not printed.
 
I am using win95. I used hyperterm for the terminal. It works fine with
Hexmon, so I figured the icc printf routines would work also.

Does anyone have any suggestions?


Thanks

Hello All,

Some time back I sent a message to the HandyBoard list to enquire if 
anyone had a machine code programming monitor operating system for 
the HandyBoard, similar to the Buffalo Monitor on Motorolla's EVB 
boards.
(The Buffalo system allows downloading of S19 machine code 
routines, via a terminal program, and allows various machine code 
debugging routines)

Apparently the answer was NO, but what also arised was that others 
were interested in such a system as well.

Well, I have developed a limited Buffallo system for the Handy Board, 
I am using it in my Microprocessors class now.

If anyone is interested, they can download it from my web page at:

http://132.234.46.5/programs/index.shtml

The Buffalo routine, and a word document describing the routine is 
included.
Also, my Editor, Assembler, and Download program shell can also be 
obtained from the web site.

Hello everybody,
A few month ago, someone told us that we can use port D as an ouput. =
But, we've just read on the Handy Board FAQ that it was not possible. =
So, where is the truth ???

Help, help, help !!!!!!!
We need 8 ouputs (and also 8 inputs) to do our project, any good idea =
will be welcome.

thanks in advance. :)

where in the FAQ does it say that it's NOT possible?  If you look at
the link 

http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/faq/index.html#digout

it explains how to use Port D as outputs.

> Help, help, help !!!!!!!
> We need 8 ouputs (and also 8 inputs) to do our project, any good idea will be
 welcome.

now, to get 8 outputs, you might have to add an expansion latch,
because you only get 4 from Port D.  There is a TO3 on the expansion
header that you can use, and PA7 on the dig input bank can be made to
be an output.  that gives you 6.  if you absolutely need the 2 more,
see the instructions prepared by Bill Coghill at

  http://www.ednet.co.uk/~bill_altaudio/DigitalIO.html

Subject: polaroid sonar problems
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/enriched; charset="us-ascii"

We continue to progress on our first robot here at Northwestern but have run into a problem with our sonars.  We have run out of solutions to try and would appreciate any help from people experienced with the polaroid sonar modules.


Our sonar is hooked up to our Handy Board following the "offical" instructions. The unit itself is mounted on an acrylic stand where it is pressed into place to hold it.  We have also loaded the code as it appears on your website:


http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/Projects/handy-board/software/sonar.html


Unfortunately, when we execute the program all that we get on the display are random numbers (usually around 800 and 1125).  It makes no difference how far away we are from the wall we are trying to measure.  


Our real probelm seems to be to get the correct echo to trigger the timing loop.  As it stands, a count of 800 corresponds to a distance of .22 ft which is closer than the board can measure and much closer than our wall.  Have you seen this problem before?  Do you have any advice on how to correct it?  


Thanks for your help.  If you need more information please e-mail me and I will get it to you asap.

Help:

I am short one ds1233 for my freshman engineering class.  Is there
anyway to jumper around this part.  I understand that it is in the
circuit to prevent the cpu from losing it's mind on low voltage.  I
would be willing to put up with reloading pcode after every power down,
until I can get another ds1233.  BTW does anyone know of a quick
supplier who takes small orders of these guys.  Thanks in advance.

PS  I can get the necessary 5 volts from one of the headers, but still
can't get the board to go into download mode???

Hi all

if anyone has problems using the 6500 series for distances below 35cm by
using the binh signal I have a possible solution to the problem. We also
expierienced problems using the sensors for distances between 15cm and
40cm. We finally found out that the digital chip (TL851) on the 6500
board gets huge voltage spikes making it detect an echo even if there
was none.
We solved the problem by adding an additional capacitior to the
powersupply.

THE REWORK
Solder a tantal c (1uF) directly to pin 3(Gnd) and pin 1 (+) of chip U2
(TL851).

This will filter the spikes keeping them from droping below 2.5 V.
If anyone has a better way of solving this problems please tell me.

cu                      TOM

Subject: questions on optical encoders
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi, everyone
Hi, i am currently doing a thesis topic "Micromouse project". And, I am
going to purchase an small optical encoder to measure the speed,
acceleration and distance that my mice has taken. My mice is driven by a
DC motor, so the opti. enco.is used to measure the speed of it.
So, can u guys suggest some good models of optical encoders that fit my
DC motor.
features of optical encoders i prefer:
-- small size (<1.5 inch dia)
-- frequency response: 100kHz
-- small power supply
-- 2-channel quadrature, TTL square wave outputs
-- shaft speed >= 10,000rpm     <-- is this enough for an micromouse?

Thank you for your response on my questions.
Paul

They have some low cost variants that we used and were very pleased with.

It is 1.78" in diameter at it's widest point :-(

I am not sure what you mean when you refer to a "frequency response" with
respect to an optical encoder.

> -- small power supply

I presume that you require the encoder to draw very low current.  This
particular offering draws 27 mA max.

Check.

With the bearing option, US D. specifies that the encoder can maintain
continuous duty at 10,000 RPM.

I haven't had a chance to experiment with this yet, but it look like a
something that might work. Have you check out any mice, some of them have two
encoders on them. they are small, low power and cheap. I plan to experiment
with them this summer, and if anyone has used them, please tell us how it
worked and what you did.

Hello,
I am curently trying to use encoders with quadratures outputs
If someone has already developped a program for such encoders I would be
very interested in.
A 8 bits counters can also be connected to this encoders. If someone has
already developped a program which could read 8 bits counters I am also
interested in.
In fact I am interested in anything that could help me to make these
encoders work.
Thanks in advance.

Howdy from the world of program failure...
please consider this scenario: 

1. let's say I write a series of functions, put them in a file, and
download the file to my HB.
Now I write a program that uses the previously downloaded functions, and
download it to the HB. 

2. now I decide that 3:00am is too late to continue programming, so I exit
IC, turn off my pc, turn off my HB.

3. Three hours later, I get a burning desire to do some more work on the
program, so I fire up the pc, turn on the HB, and run IC.  I don't need to
make any changes to the functions (loaded in step 1.) and they are still in
the HB's memory, so I do a little work on the program which references
them, and proceed to download it to the HB.  

Question 1:  did I just overwrite the functions I had loaded in step 1 with
the program in step 3? (t/f) 

Question 2: if question 1 is true, why didn't I get an error message saying
that the function(s) aren't defined?

Hi.  I teach 8th grade science and I am very interested in adding Robotics
to our curriculum in the fall.  I have been following with keen interest,
the listserv on the handyboard.  Could somebody tell me, where I can obtain
reading materials to help me get started in robotics?  I am sure that this
question falls short of the things I have been reading, but I am very
interested in learning more, so I can add this to my Advanced Science
class.
Thanks for your help.

problem, and I'd really appreciate any help -- I have the virtual robot 
finished, but a main part of my project was to bring the virtual robot

class functions aren't used until the last half of the program. If IC 
can't do that, what software/hardware that is easy to get ahold of can?

Subject: Serial Communication: HB -> Win95 
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I am using the serial_putchar() and serial_getchar() communication routines
on the HandyBoard, and everything is working fine from the PC to the HB.
However, I am having trouble getting the HB to send data back to the PC. 

Here is main() on the HB:

void main(void) {
	char c = '!';
	int cnt = 1;
	disable_pcode_serial();   
	while (cnt <= 10) {
		c = serial_getchar();
		printf("[%d]=%c ", cnt, c, c);
		serial_putchar('!');
		cnt++;
	}
	reenable_pcode_serial();   
	printf("   HB Mode!");
}

The serial line is set correctly, but I haven't been able to get anything
back to the host.

I have included the code that I am compiling under VC++4.0 and Win95 below.
If you have any suggestions of what I can do (other than trying to get
Linux running on my laptop), I'd love to hear them. 

Thanks!

Hi Kate

you could use some precompiler to convert C++ to C.  I think that the GNU
C++ compilers have such a precompiler. (At least the older ones do.)

Mime-Version: 1.0

I am trying to use one of the Polaroid 6500 kits from Wirz with my senior
design project.  It doesn't exactly use a handyboard, but our
microcontroller is virtually identical at the lowest level.  The problem
is when we attach the device to the scope, we NEVER see any significant
voltage on the ECHO pin.  With the INIT pulsing 5V every second, we still
get nothing but residual noise (kind of a lot, but at no more than .5V)
and the remnants of the sixteen pulses from the ping.  I hear a clicking
sound too, which was unexpected and is quite annoying.  Is this normal?
How come I never have any voltage on ECHO?  I am not using the blanking
inhibit at all, and if I look at the noise at about a 200mv setting on the
scope, I can see a shape in the noise that changes with an objects
proximity to the transducer, but it is not anything like a logic level.  I
have tried a million different ways of hooking this thing up and have
tried two different driver boards.  This is getting ridiculous. How does
one go about testing the device?  I am powering it with a HP E3631A Triple
output DC power supply with the current limiter maxed at 5.0 Amps, which
should be enough to cover the 2A pinging surge.  Please help me figure out
what is going on or a better way to test it.  We connected it to the
microcontroller as it connects to the handyboard, but that of course
didn't work either.  If you can respond via email, that would be best
because I don't get this list regularly.  Please respond soon so I don't
fail senior design!! ;-)  Take it easy,

Chris

hi from France,

I already have a handy-board running with a 11A1 chip and I plan to adapt

Does someone have any experience about running IC with this chip?
Will it work with the pcode_hb.s19 file and standard downloaders (DL or DLM)?

Thanks for any help ;-))

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I am trying to use one of the Polaroid 6500 kits from Wirz with my
senior design project.  It doesn't exactly use a handyboard, but our
microcontroller is virtually identical at the lowest level.  The problem
is when we attach the device to the scope, we NEVER see any significant
voltage on the ECHO pin.  With the INIT pulsing 5V every second, we
still get nothing but residual noise (kind of a lot, but at no more
than .5V)and the remnants of the sixteen pulses from the ping.  I hear
a clicking sound too, which was unexpected and is quite annoying.  Is
this normal?  How come I never have any voltage on ECHO?  I am not
using the blanking inhibit at all, and if I look at the noise at about
a 200mv setting on the scope, I can see a shape in the noise that
changes with an objects proximity to the transducer, but it is not
anything like a logic level.  I have tried a million different ways of
hooking this thing up and have tried two different driver boards.  I
am going to buy another transducer tommorrow, but this is getting
ridiculous. How does one go about testing the device?  I am powering
it with a HP E3631A Triple output DC power supply with the current
limiter maxed at 5.0 Amps, which should be enough to cover the 2A
pinging surge.  Please help me figure out what is going on or a better
way to test it.  We connected it to the microcontroller as it connects
to the handyboard, but that of course didn't work either.  If you can
respond via email, that would be best because I don't get this list
regularly.  Please respond soon so I don't fail senior design!! ;-) 
Take it easy,

Chris

Are you using a pullup resistor on the ECHO pin?  If not that is your
problem.
The ECHO output is an open collector driver which requires an 4.7 K pull-up
resistor between the output and Vcc.
The pull-up is necessary for connecting the module to a digital input.

I power mine with a 7805 voltage regulator and it seems to work fine but i'm
not using it continiously.

The clicking sound is normal.

Another thing I noticed that if I ground the transducer it malfunctions.

I hope that helps ,  Let me know!

I am interested in using the Handy Board, but I have a few questions about it first. Please help.  :)

 I noticed the Handy Board supports 4 motors but I am interested in using stepper motors with it. Is this possible? 

 If so what modifications would be nessary to accomodate for the extra connections needed for the stepper motors. Also what would I have to do as far as having to deal with the extra current from the stepper motors as apposed to regular DC motors.

 Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated.
 
Thank you,

Has anyone tried to use one of the TI  tsl1301 or 1401 linear sensors with
the HB.  I ended up with a few but am having a tough time trying to figure
out what the data sheets are trying to tell me.  Not real clear (to me).

Why does it seem like everyone except me needs a pullup resistor and
perhaps a capacitor somewhere to operate the Polaroid?  I've never had any
problems without any of these components.  ???

The first time I connected the sensor, it worked perfectly.
Maybe I my Handy Board happens to have better components?  :-/

Did you follow the instructions in the HB Assembly debug? at

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/hbassem/hbassem5.html

it says:

  Output Stage
  
  If LED9R fails to light after the poke command is issued, trace the 
  following progression of signals. Please refer to the infrared output 
  schematic: 
  
  * 6811 Timer Output 2. This is the signal from the 6811 that enables
  the IR transmission circuit. Check pin 28 of the 6811; it should be
  high.  The signal is wired to pin 2 of U7; it also should be high.
  
  * Oscillator Output. Look at the signal on pin 3U7; when the 6811
  timer output 2 is high, it should be a 40 kHz square wave. If not,
  check for proper installation of U7, R4, and C6.
  
  * Inverter. The 40 kHz square wave should go to pin 1 of U9, where it
  is inverted and output on pin 2 of the same chip.
  
  * Transistor Drive. The 40 kHz signal then passes through R3, where it
  is delivered to the base of Q1. Check for the signal's presence at
  these points.
  
  * Transistor and LED Wiring. Check that the emitter lead of the
  transistor is properly grounded, and that LED9R and R5 have good
  solder joints.
  


let us know the results.

Hi all,

i have built a handyboard. It works fine. But on Digital PIN  9 "PAI" i
got allways high level (1) during test via "hptest.c". I think i haven=B4=
t
any soldering problems.

That=B4s wrong ???

Hi,

i have some questions about PWM and encoder.

I made following tests:

1)    Speed :   motor(0,100)     my encoder count f.e. 20clicks / per
second
2)    Speed:    motor(0,50)        my encoder count f.e. 15clicks / per
second
3)    Speed:    motor(0,40)        my encoder count f.e. 12clicks / per
second

Why are=B4nt  the clicks linear?

thanks for help

well....I might be the way you are powering the sensors ???
Maybe luck ????

:))))))

Actually I don't why you don't need any of those supporting parts.
A short question ...For what range are you using the sensors (are you using the
binh signal) ??

We never had any problems using the sensors with a range above 40 cm.  But as soon
as we tried to measure down
to 15 cm (using binh) we had false echo signals.
One strange thing to this story...about 15 month ago, when I first built an
interface to those sensors they worked just fine. Then suddenly after rebuilding
the interface (using bigger caps and a interfaceboard instead of a breadboard)
they didn't work anymore....I don't know anymore wether I also changed the
sensorboards or not.
So I ended up with the problem not to be able to use the sensors with binh.

After adding the caps as discribed in an earlier mail they just worked fine.
So if anyone can track those problems down to one cause please let mie know....

Thanks

Tom

Hello everybody,

Is something wrong with this code or is it IC?

{ int a[4][4], i; for (i=0; i<4; i++) { a[i][i]=i; } }

When I type this at the IC prompt it complains:

Downloading 79 bytes (addresses C200-C24E): 79 loaded
COMPILER ERROR!: 2 extra bytes left on board stack

Any ideas?

The reason you don't need a pull up resistor for the Handy Board is because
the Handy Board has built in 47k pull up resistors on the digital inputs!

The nonlinearity has to due with the characteristics of your motor.  You
will find that a single step of power at the low end has a greater
effect on the speed than a single step at the high end, as the motor
approaches its top speed.  The relationship will change somewhat
depending on if the motor is loaded or unloaded, too.

You can build a stepper motor controller on a separate circuit board, then
remove the motor control IC's off the handy board
and use the output signals to control your stepper.  Will have to write a
program to run it.  you will need a min of 4 outputs to drive
2 steppers 2) for Direction and 2) for steping.  That's if you use a stepper
controller IC.  You can power your steppers of a separate power supply.  The
handy board uses 8 output lines to control it's DC motors.

You can use a UCN5804 stepper conrtoller IC  or build your own.

In fact, that's weird.. I can't answer to that. To me, I'm pretty sure that IC
would have gave me an error, like when I try to load a C program without
having
loaded the ICB containing the special function used by this C program. For
example, i can't load sony-ir.c without having loaded first sony-ir.icb.
Maybe Randy Sargent or Fred could answer that question?

The funny thing is, it doesn't complain about arrays smaller than 4x4. All 
values are stored correctly for an array of size 3x3.

What's this 'magic' number 4 then?

To answer my own question, at least partially, here is a Win95 Host
program to communicate (single bytes) with the HandyBoard over a serial
line:

/* Win95 Visual C++ Host Code to talk to HandyBoard */

#include <conio.h> // _outp, _inp
#include <stdlib.h> // sleep
#include <stdio.h> // printf

unsigned short PORT = 0x3f8; // COM1: 0x3f8 on my computer

int send(char c) {
        return _outp( PORT, c);
}

char receive() {
        char retval;
        retval = _inp( PORT);
        _sleep(50);                  // this was necessary; too fast a
machine?
        retval = _inp( PORT);
        return retval;
}


void main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
        char c;
        char key = ' ';
        while (key != 'q') {
                key = getch();
                send(key);
                printf("Sent %c\n", key); 
                c = receive();
                printf("Got %c as a return value\n", c);
        }
}


Here is a sample HB program to talk to:

void disable_pcode_serial()   
/* necessary to receive characters using serial_getchar */
{
   poke(0x3c, 1);
}

void reenable_pcode_serial()   
/* necessary for IC to interact with board again */
{
   poke(0x3c, 0);
}

/*
======================================================================
For sending and receiving single bytes, you can use Randy's IC code:
*/

void serial_putchar(int c)
{
   while (!(peek(0x102e) & 0x80));  /* wait until serial transmit empty
*/
   poke(0x102f, c);  /* send character */
}

int serial_getchar()
{
   while (!(peek(0x102e) & 0x20)); /* wait for received character */
   return peek(0x102f);
}

void main(void) {
        char c = ' ';
        disable_pcode_serial();   
        while (c != 'q') {
                c = serial_getchar();
                printf("\nReceived = %c   ", c); 
                if (c == '1') {
                        serial_putchar(analog(0));
                } else if (c == 'a') {
                        serial_putchar(knob());
                }                       

      }
        reenable_pcode_serial();   
        printf("\nHB Mode!");
}


If anyone has a better solution, please let me know.

The 100, 50, 40, etc. are not really "speeds".  They are power.  It is
related to the average voltage level of your output.  Speed depends on the
torque and characteristics of your motor.  You can hold on the the wheel
and still drive the motor at 100.  It would be 0clicks / per second in
this case. =20

Well, actually, it's not power either.  Power is V * I.  Sorry, it's
actually the voltage.

When it first worked for me, I used the HB NiCd.  I grounded binh and it
worked.  I used binh to measure like 7 inches and it worked fine too.

Hi all, first, the URL:

  http://www.media.mit.edu/~fredm/projects/tc98/

I went to last weekend's Fire-Fighting Robot Contest at Trinity
College, along with my colleague Steve Ocko, who had built a cute
robot based on our network-cricket technology (see
<http://www.media.mit.edu/~fredm/projects/cricket/techtalk/buscrick.html>
for more on that).

We spent about a day programming, and had a pretty good
wall-following-at-a-distance behavior going using sharp gp2d02 optical
distance sensors.

the best part of our design was how it would put out the candle:  a
LEGO hook and ladder would extend, which would invert a canister of
vinegar into a pellet of baking soda, which caused a strong stream of
foam and CO2 to gush out of the fire hose!

unfortunately, just before our run, i let the robot accidentally
trigger itself, and it spilled vinegar all over itself, and several of
the sensor shorted out.  when i put the robot down to compete, i
didn't realize it but one of the distance sensors wasn't working, so
it just drove around in a circle.  it was quite disappointing.  argh.

anyway, it was great seeing everyone at the contest.  enjoy the
pictures.

Subject: A few questions....
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

First I want everyone to know two things. First I am new to this list.
Second, I have moderate knowledge of electronics....

Until about a few weeks ago, I had been working with Basic Stamps 1 and 2.
After looking at all the information about HandyBoards/Rug Warrior boards,
I decided to take the plunge and bought a pair of Rug Warrior Pro Kits,
both with Brains/Brawn.

I have noticed that alot of different articles and websites refer to both
boards. I know that there are differences between the two, and being that I
am still learning Interactive C ver 3.2, which came with the Rug kits...

One of the problems I am having is with the IR circut. What is used for
this is:

IS1U60 Detector
74HC14 Hex Schmitt trigger inverter
0.1uF cap (Bypass cap for 74HC14)
0.0022uF cap (Part of IR Oscillator Circut)
and of course a pot to adjust the freq of the oscillator (10k)

What is happening with BOTH rugs is that the distance is no more than 3-4
inches. When adjusting the pot, very little at that, the left LED appears
to be SUPER sensitive, while the right side appears to work just fine. 

I have tried the electrical tape on the base of the LEDS, which does not
make any difference. 

From what I understand, I should be able to get at least a good distance of
6 inches with these rugs, however I dont know what else to try..


The other question I have is about IC ver 3.2.  It seems that more people
are using older versions as opposed to the newest ones. I grabbed an older
copy that I was able to use with the examples that I had found on the web,
and to be perfectly honest, it was easier to me to learn how to program the
rugs. IS it me or is this something common????


I have a handyboard on order, which I intend to use on a homemade project.
Just in case anyone is wondering why I have to rugs, and now going into a
handy board, its simple, when it comes to building  the robot brain, its no
problem, BUT the actual body/drive, forget it, I am about as useful as a
porcupine in a nudist colony!!!!!


Any help/suggestions GREATLY appreciated...

Generally the capacitor is the problem :-) The capacitor in the
original note is there to pull BINH true* to allow the sensor to
detect things that are closer than 18". Generally, when you
include it, unless the design of the system holding the
transducer is well damped, doing this will cause you to get
nothing but small values has the board detects latent vibrations
in the transducer mounting as the returning echo. Without
connecting up BINH you won't see things closer than 18" but you
will get much more reliable operation.

* I don't recall off the top of my head if that means pulling it
low early or pulling it high :-(.

I was wondering if anyone out there could send me some very basic, easy to
understand programs that could help me figure out how to use sonar
modules.

residual noise?  It was my understanding that the Polaroid module used
pulse time differentials to relay distance information.  One need only
look at the difference in time, between the leading edge of the init
pulse, and the leading edge of the echo pulse to determine the distance
from an object.  This is different from modules that generate a variable
voltage between two limits proportional to the Time of Flight of a given
ping.  When you say "noise", it makes me think that you are dismissing
the actual Time of Flight information as a glitch in the output.  You
should see about .9 ms between the leading edge of the init pulse and
the falling edge of the echo pulse for every foot between your transducer
and a given target.

Someone please correct and clarify this if I am wrong.  I don't remember
specifically what version of the classic Polaroid transducer
driver/detector we used, and Chris may be using a different one.

Every transducer I have ever used has had a human audible component that
was heard every time the transducer emitted a ping.  I think this is
called "ringing", and is due to the emitter plate flexing, and generating
harmonics which may fall into the human audio range.  Check out the
Fourier transform of a digital pulse and you can see the frequency
components that we hear.

Could your scope leads be a bit flaky?  How are you triggering?  If you
are using a digital scope, try and configure the instrument for "manual"
trigger, as opposed to "auto" trigger.  There will most likely be a
variable setting to allow you to set the trigger threshold.  All the
digital Tek's do this.  I seem to recall it being under the "Vertical
Menu", or was it "Acquire"? *shrug*  Then attempt to "capture" the echo
edge event.  It was a 5 volt signal; have no doubts there.

How did you connect it to your Micro?  Again, the device we used did not
supply an analogish level to represent the Time of Flight of a given
audionic pulse.  The time information was determined by measuring the
difference between the init pulse and the echo pulse with an Input
Capture.  With a 2 Mhz E-clock, the magic number turned out to be about
150 TPU counts per foot.  I don't remember precisely how we got that..
probably trial and error.

Note that I have forwarded my response to the Handyboard list as well.

Have faith, and good luck.

Are you using the "smooth" PWM motor routines?  Note also, that a DC motor
does not change velocity linearly with an increase in current unless it is
under load.  This was a recently asked question on the list.  Maybe
grepping the digest for "motor" "DC" and "PWM"?

Hey, I just wanted to thank everybody for there help with this, it did
turn out to be the pull up resistor problem, I feel like a moron.  We
used the handyboardy sonar interfacing schematic when we wired it up and
failed to realize that we aren't ACTUALLY USING A HANDYBOARD!  This means,
of course, that we need to provide our own pull up resistors for the
input, and when that was added, everything worked perfectly (Doh!)  So
anyways it works on the the scope and in our project for our preliminary
ECE demonstration yesterday, thanks to you guys.  I am still having a bit
of a problem, though, it seems I am getting false echos, or latent echos
every now a and then, like I will pull my hand away from the sensor and it
will not notice for a second that its new target is the ceiling.  I looked
at the echo pulse on the scope and it seems a bit dirty, where should I
throw a capacitor (and what rating) to eliminate this.  I've heard a lot
about caps for these things, but I am not sure where it should be placed.
We are not using te BINH line, so I don't need a cap there as far as I
know.  Suggestions would be much appreciated, although its not an
emergency this time!  Thanks again everybody.  Take it easy,

Chris Moylan

Dear Jan-Sipke,

Two-dimensional arrays are not implemented in the freeware IC 2.8 --
sorry.  I just tested and your code works fine with IC 3.1/3.2.

Hi

For a relatively simple solution you may want to look at

http://www.cctc.demon.co.uk/stepper.htm

I have connected and run steppers using this method. It does not get
the  best from the motors but it will let you experiment easily.

Subject: Smooth PWM routines for IC 3.1/3.2


Thanks to Julian Skidmore and Scott Seaton, we have a version of pcode and
libraries for IC 3.1/3.2 which implement Julian's "smooth pwm" routines for
the MIT Handyboard.

To grab these, please go to the following address:

ftp://newtonlabs.com/contrib/smooth-pwm

I've included the "README" file from the directory at the end of this
message to inform those who don't already know how Julian's modification
might help you.

Many thanks to Julian and Scott for contributing this feature.

-- Randy

---------------

README for IC 3.1 Smooth PWM routines for the MIT Handyboard
4/24/98

The files in this directory are contributed by 

            Julian Skidmore <skidmorj@cs.man.ac.uk>

and

            Scott Seaton <Scott.Seaton@Aus.Sun.COM>

The "Smooth PWM" routines, designed by Julian Skidmore, allow for
finer control of the amount of power going to the 4 motor outputs on
the MIT Handyboard.  

While the "motor" library function appears to allow 100 forward power
levels and 100 backwards power levels, in fact, the -100 to 100 is
quantized to 8 forward and 8 backwards power levels in the standard
library and pcode.

Julian's modifications to the pcode and library allow for full -100 to 100
resolution for setting power.  This can be particularly useful when running
low-voltage motors on the Handyboard, where power levels need to be kept
low.

--------------------------

TO INSTALL:

Simply copy pcode_hb.s19 and lib_hb.c into your IC libraries
directory.  You might want to back up the old versions of the same
files first.

Next, be sure to download the updated pcode file.  You should see
"SMOOTHPWM" on the LCD screen on bootup.

Note that if the new library is used with the old pcode, or
vice-versa, the "motor" command will not behave at all linearly with
respect to the power command (although 0 and 100 will still work as
normal).

If you have problems downloading pcode_hb.s19 and lib_hb.c, you can
instead download and unzip "smooth.zip", which contains the same files.

Thanks for this excellent article on driving
stepper motors from the Handboard.

One little yet very important question: when you
say "the common wires need to be connected to the
motor positive supply" what exact handyboard
pinout are you referring to, and with an
unmodified handyboard, what voltage would this
drive the stepper motor at?

Thanks,
/Max

PS:  Another free source of stepper motors is from
any old dot-matrix printer you plan on
discarding.  I ripped mine apart and found two
6-wire stepper motors: one driving the print head
and the other taking care of the paper feeder.

Hi!
Is there anybody else having trouble running his V2X with Tom

Any help appreciated!

Note that sonar in air is susceptible to the same environmental
issues as sonar anywhere. In particular it is susceptible to
changes in temperature and changes in air pressure. Both of which
create a boundary layer that reflects some of the energy. For a
really cool experiment blow cold air in front (across) the sonar
transducer. You should get an echo back from the 'cold front'
you've produced.

Subject: IR Transmit


I am trying to get two handyboards to exchange data via the IR. I have
tried code from the Dave Negro and Pete McCann code, but I still
cannot get reliable data transmission at any range.

Summary of situation:

REC80-IR.icb: Reliable reception of remote control codes.(sanyo and
sharp VCRs)
sony-ir.icb : Mostly reliable reception of sharp RC codes.

REC80-TX.icb: sends something, but quite unrecognisable as the
original word of data.
sony-transmit.icb: I cannot get anything across.

r22-ir.* is not loaded at any time.

My IR TX led is 940nm (not centred on 950nm like the receiver).

Does anyone have any idea what I am doing wrong?

Thanks,

michael.

There is a little strip of four pins for external battery power and are
available with the standard battery pack installed. Two of these are
battery positive, two are at ground. Shorting them out is a good way to
let the smoke genie loose.

Well, everything seemed ok, but now (we are in a crunch again, the
final presentation is Friday!) there is another problem.  We seem to
be getting some erroneous distances and I think I know why.  The echo
signal is pretty noisy, so my question is, how can I use a capacitor
to filter the ECHO signal without changing the readings?  Please let
me know as soon as you can, and thanks again!

Chris

PS - it is also mounted in a small box, should I damp the back side of
the transducer with something to stop reverberation?  I'll be in the
lab all day trying everything, wish me luck!

Hello,

Has anyone figured out a GOOD way to expand the memory on the Handy Board?
I would like to try using a 32 pin simm (I have sizes ranging from 256k to
4M) to store mappings (distance and turns) created by the initial
"adventure" it takes of that area for use at another time.

If anyone has found a way to expand the memory let me know.

Thanks,

I am looking for good methods for quick prototyping and would appreciate all
suggestions.

In Mobile Robots by Joseph L. Jones and Anita M Flynn, they suggest using
Scotchflex by 3M and Speedwire by Bicc-Vero company as two good alternatives
to using breadboard or wire-wrap technology.

As noted in the book, breadboards have the advantage that they are
relatively inexpensive, easy to change, and components are on the same side
as the wiring.  The problems with breadboard technology includes low
component density, stray capacitance between rows, wiring sockets in
breadboards are easily sprung, and it is easy to unintentionally dislodge
connections when a lot of wires are in the breadboard.

Wire-wrap has the advantage of providing more secure connections that
breadboards.  However, the resulting boards are thick, inconvenient to make
changes especially when the wire you want to change is at the bottom of pin,
and uses point-to-point technologies which is messy for connecting the
ground wires.

The problem with Scotchflex by 3M is that I cannot find anyone at 3M that
knows anything about the sockets, plug strips, or the wiring tool discussed
in the book.  If you have these items, I would very much appreciate if you
can give me the part numbers for them.

The problem with Speedwire is that I am told they have discontinued their
line of Speedwire products.

If you know of good alternatives to wire-wrap and breadboards or if you know
of good sources for Scotchflex or Speedwire please pass that information on
to me.

Thank you in advance.

Subject: Schematic Question
Priority: normal

I have been looking at the schematic for the handyboard and the 
RS232/Charger board. 

I noticed something that seems wrong.  But how could it since this 
has been out for some time?

Power goes out pin 4 of J10 on the Charger board and pin 4 on 
Handyboard J5 is grounded.  Is that right?  The UNSWPWR on the 
handyboard is connected to pin 3 of J5.

What am I missing?

You're missing the fact that the telephone style RJ-11 cable is an
inverting cable. see page 11 of 16 of the Handyboard FAQ at
http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/faq/index.html
for a discussion and diagram of this  (and the consequences of using the
wrong cable!).

   I recently contacted Vero aboout Speedwire. The product is indeed
discontinued and they have no old stock in the UK.
However, speedwire pins are, apparently made for them by someone else.
Unfortunately they could not find out (at that time) who by.
Perhaps the original manufacturer could be found?

Hi,

Wouldn't it be possible to wire them both to the same input port and turn
on the one that you want information from and turn the other off?  For
example, the polaroid sonar data states that you can control turning on
and off the device, so you turn that one on for the majority of the time
but turn it off momentarilly and turn on the V2x to get information and
then turn it back off and turn on the sonar again.  OR,  can it be done in
a hardware fashion (which probably would be better)?

Thanks in advance,

Scott

Hi,
I am having problems loading my files onto handyboard.
Whenever I try to load a file, it says ;

It used to work fine before and I don't know why I am having this problem
all of sudden.
Can anyone help me please?

If you only use one motor controller IC you  can use the 16 pin socket of
the second motor control to get 4 more outputs.

Then you can connect the INIT and BINH to these and have Port D control your
V2x compass.
All you have to do is modify your sonar.c program to use these new pins.

I hope that helps.
P.S. If you need more info let me know.

It suggests you are not loading lib_hb.c on start up. If you type list files
at the IC command line you should see this file listed, as well as any
others.  If it isn't there, check your lib_hb.lis file and be sure lib_hb.c
is listed in it.

Try to look up MicroSim ...or something like that name.
It has a crippled evaluation package that may suit your needs.
I think the company is the developer of psplice.

Subject: Max232CPE Substitutions
Priority: normal

I used a Max202 in place of the Max232.  I installed it with the 10uF 
caps.  

Since the 202 can be used with .1 and I already installed the 
10uF ones.  I decided to switch it for a 232.  The 202 checked out (V 
wise) like the installation instructruction testing.  

I had a bag of Max232CPE from Active that actually had DS14C232 
inside.  I installed one and everything checked out except that the 
step (3.2.2) that required measuring 9-10V at pin 3 of J9 (while
shorting pin 6 to pin 10) actually measured slightly under 5V.  

I tried a different Max232 chip and none of these other chips read 
9-10 V.  They were actually between 0 and 5 V.  

Is this still acceptable or do I really need 9-10 V?  These parts are 
supposed to be equivelant.

Besides using a motor driver chip such as L293D, what else can i do to

Say, is there a method which can control the motor by totally software,
without a motor driver chip?

Thank you for all your replies.

I cannot locate a DS1233 chip.  I have tired DigiKey, Jameco, Mouser, 
Active.  What is a good source for this part?

I have an MC34064.  Looks similiar except that it has no 350mSec 
delay and a different pinout.  Has anyone tried this chip without any 
caps?

Motorola warns against using caps at the input of the RESET circuit.  
I also don't see any notes that indicate that a delay is even 
necessary.  Looks like this chip should work fine without any caps.

Thanks

Please forgive this probably silly question; as a software person I only dabble
in hardware as a hobby:

I want to make my own little expansion board and it requires signals from the
expansion connectors of the HandyBoard.  In particular I want to run a ribbon
cable out of the HB from the same header that the LCD plugs in to (GND thru D7).

How can I do this and still have my LCD work?  Is there some kind of header
available that will 'fork' the connection 2 ways?

Thanks,

Subject: Testing with PCBUG11
Priority: normal

I have assembled the HandyBoard up to the point of adding the SRAM.  
I am still waiting for my SRAM to arrive.  But, I want to check out 
as much as possible.  

Every step checked out fine to this point.

I have two options at this point.  I have an 6264 (8K x 8) that will 
give me 8K for not (not using IC yet).  I also have an 811E2 in the 
board for now.

I tired to run PCBUG, to test the communications with the MCU but I 
get the following error each time I try to communicate with the 
board:

Fatal Error[9] - Hardware communication failure.  PCBug terminated.

This error makes me wonder if something might be wrong with my RS232.

Questions:
1) What should the baud rate be during boot sequence?  
2) Does PCBug set it automatically?  
3) Do I have to set it from Win95 before running PCBug?
4) Does anyone have any suggestions how to test the RS232 using 
PCBug11?

I was wondering if anyone knows where I could purchase the Sharp Is1U60 IR
detector. I have looked for it, however none of the distributors I have
checked with even carry it.
I tried Digikey, Mouser Electronics, JDR, Jameco, BG Micro, and others.

Any information GREATLY appreciated.

My problem turned out to be with Win 95.  If I boot to DOS the 
PCBUG11 program works fine.  It fails to work when working from a DOS 
window.

I can now communicate with the MCU so my RS232 must be fine.  When 
working from the command line in PCBUG, I cannot access the SRAM.  
A15 never changes from LOW.

It is as though I cannot access anything except the internal MCU 
locations.  I can read/write EEPROM ok.

1) Is it possible to access external SRAM from PCBUG?
2) Shouldn't  one be able to control the port data from PCBUG?  I've 
tried but get BAD ADDRESS (or BAD MEMORY something like that).  Like 
it's not there
3) Still would like to know baud rate in boot mode?
4) Is the LCD manual on the web somewhere?  Maybe I'll play with that 
tomorrow.

Looks like I'll have fun tomorrow playing with this.

Hi again,  I think i should change my previous question to the
following.

Is there any alternatives to control a DC motor motion (speed, direction
etc) without using a motor driver?
how? please explain briefly.

Thank you for your replies.

Subject: MODB - How Is Expanded Mode Entered
Priority: normal

If MODB pin is always grounded, how does the MCU get into expanded 
mode to access the 32K SRAM?

The data sheet shows MODB HIGH to enter expanded mode.  It show MODB 
LOW to enter single chip mode.

What am I missing?

Subject: My LCD driver

This is a multi-part message in MIME format.
--------------EB45157C079F92369D49D338
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Attached to this message is the LCD driver I wrote for the Handyboard
written using ICC11. Feel free to use it.

Some notes on it:

The driver is designed to operate asynchronously. This is because the
LCD can take several milliseconds to complete its operations. If you
busy-wait and the LCD has just started something, you will sit there
waiting, with interupts blocked, yuck!

The main driver is a routine called 'do_lcd()' it is called by my system
'tick' interrupt every millisecond. It checks to see if there is
anything in the queue for the LCD and then it checks to see that the LCD
driver is installed in the zero page of RAM. If neither is true it
returns.

When there is something to do, the driver dereferences a pointer to call
lcd_write(). That routine turns off interrupts, flips the 68HC11 into
single chip mode, and checks to see if the LCD is busy, if it is, it
returns, otherwise it dequeues a character and writes it to the LCD and
returns. In either case it is back out of single chip mode with
interrupts back on in a few microseconds. 

In either event, I call lcd_write once a millisecond (if it something to
do) and if doesn't manage to accomplish anything in 10 tries (ie 10mS)
then I set a flag to indicate the LCD is not working. This keeps the
board from hanging if you unplug the LCD.

P.S. I've also attached an S19 file that shows it in operation.

Subject: IC communication problem
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,

Lately I am having problems communicating with the handyboard after it
is reset.  
I can download the pcode_hb.s19 file using hbdl.exe downloader.

When the Handyboard is reset by toggling the power switch, the following
is observed.

1st symptom : No welcome message on screen

Running ic.exe after the reset causes something to be written to the
port as indicated by the RS-232 minitester, but nothing is returned from
the Handyboard side.

2nd symptom: <Following log>
	Attempting to link to board on port com2
	Synchronizing with board
	Board disconnected or not responding, retrying
	<infinite loop of above statement>

I have checked the Memory Power and it appears to be constant at 5.5V.
I have not checked it with an oscilloscope to see if there are any
spikes in the memory power.

I would appreciate comments in solving this problem.

Thank you,

Tejesh

hello

    I have a 6v 2.0amp battery. Its a lead acid battery. What is the right
way to recharge it?
    The reason I ask is because I had a 12v 7amp battery from the same
manyfacturer. I charged it using a car battery charger at the lowest setting
possible. After 2 days, the cells had expanded and the battery was bloated.
I dont want to repeat that!

thanks for any help.

Thank your for all your replies, I understand what 's going on now

Another question about the motor driver is:
Q) The PWM is a sequence of pulses switching on & off the H-Bridge.
      But what should be the rate of PWM?  1000Hz??  why?  what does the
rate of
PWM    depends on?

Hello everyone,
	I've been having a problem downloading pcode to a handyboard or
rugwarrior board from my Mac G3 (266 Mhz desktop model).  When I try to
download the bootstrap code, it reports that the bootstrap failed after
000 bytes, etc.. etc...   The funny thing is that I am able to
communicate with either the rug warrior or handyboard just fine as long
as they both have working pcode installed in them already.  I am using IC
version 3.1 and have found this behavior to be the same for both the
modem and the printer port.
	I have also found that when I try to change the definitions file
in the preferences menu to download different pcode and libraries to the
handyboard or rug warrior, IC crashes usually during the second
configuration swap.

	I thought that I'd try using IC 2.852 to see if I would get
better behavior.  Here's a transcript of the failed download:

Please place board in download mode and press RETURN
To quit, press Q
For help, press H
Downloading 256 byte bootstrap (229 data)
................................................................
................................................................
................................................................
.....................................___________________________
Timeout on serial receive.  256 chars left to receive
Perhaps the board was not connected properly or not in download mode

Please place board in download mode and press RETURN
To quit, press Q
For help, press H


	Has anybody else had similar problems?  Randy or Fred, any ideas
as to why IC doesn't like my Mac G3?  I'm running system 8.1, BTW.  

-Paul.

looks like Randy and I will both need to get our hands on a G3 to
debug our code :-)

on the interface/charger, since there's a bridge rectifier immediately
normalizing the input jack voltage -- regardless of polarity -- it
kind of doesn't matter which polarity you use.

there is a discrepancy between the int/charger schematic and PCB.  the
schematic shows the input voltage going to pins 2 and 3 of the bridge,
but on the PCB the input goes to pins 1 and 2.

i'm actually not sure of the internal wiring of the db-101 bridge, so
i can't say whether the schematic is drawn correctly (neglecting the
pin number issue and treating the bridge as a collection of 4 diodes).

i should figure out what the right answer is and revise the schematic.
as a matter of consistency, i assume the center pin negative wiring
when i create a new design (would be bad to have two different kinds
of adapters floating around the lab).  so the schematic for the
int/charger breaks this "fred standard adapter" rule.  probably, when
i laid out the int/charger board, i knew i was using an integrated
bridge DIP, and i didn't bother to follow my rule because i knew it
wouldn't matter from a practical standpoint.

i still might have gotten the PCB "right" though - it depends on the
arrangement of the diodes in the bridge.  in which case i should fix
the schematic.

Within limits, the rate doesn't matter much.  What matters is the ratio of
off time to on time (i.e., the duty cycle).  Probably, you could change the
frequency by an order of magnitude either way and get about the same results.

Subject: LCD Addressing - & - Expanded Mode
Priority: normal

Two questions:

1) I'm having a little trouble figuring out how the LCD is addressed. 
It uses A8 and A8 but also is clocked from Port A.  

Can someone explain how to properly address the LCD using ASM?

2) The Mode B pin is always grounded.  How does the system get put 
into expanded mode since that mode requires Mode B to be high during 
reset?  I assume it must be changed (the mode) by the downloaded 
program. 

Can someone explain this sequence, if I am right?  If I am wrong, can 
someone explain how expanded mode is entered?

You can only run the LCD when in single chip mode.

This leaves the chip in 'special test mode' that lets you go into and
out of expanded mode by writing the config register.

Hi, does anyone know how fast should a micromouse move?
and the other question is, will the 6811/handyboard have enough capability
(address space) for maze solving? If not, what should I need? extra memory
or 32bits processor?

Thank you for any comment!

I got mine from FutureActive. I don't remember what the cost was and I
don't remember what else I got from them, but it was more than just that. I
think I placed about 2 orders with them. I would much rather deal with
Mouser and Digikey. If you have at least $50 worth of parts to get, I would
suggest trying Allied. They seem to have everything and at great prices
compared to others, but they want you to spend at least $50. I don't
remember why I did not like ordering from FutureActive, but there was a
reason.

Yes.  Using the same set of boards, I can download pcode using IC 3.1 as

Hi Paul,

This is the first time we've heard of such a problem with IC 3.1 on the
Mac G3.  Can you verify that it is the case that pcode download works
fine for you from other Macintoshes?

So, this still doesn't help me figure out how to address the LCD.  It 
has A8 and A9 connected along with a CLK from Port A.

Does this mean that the LCD is NOT memory mapped?  Do I first have to 
write to Port B then write to Port A, to clock it.  This must mean 
that I have to go into and out of expanded mode to use both the LCD 
and the SRAM?  That's kinda wierd.

Anything else you can point me to as far as addressing the LCD and 
accessing SRAM via assembly code?

Subject: Re: dc motor blues 

Hi All;

        Along the same lines, I would LOVE to control my motors so they run
at constant speed under varying load.  I know that it's theoretically
possible to sense the RPM of a PM DC motor by tracking the drive voltage as
the commutator makes and breaks.  Has anyone tried using this as feedback in
a PWM control loop?  I'm guessing that the PWM frequency would have to be at
least an order of magnitude greater than the motor RPM.  Or would it just be
easier to use an encoder?

From the driver code I recently sent out:
 * LCD Connections on the Handyboard
 *	PORTB bit 0 - R/W
 *	PORTB bit 1 - RS (Register Select, 0 = instruction)
 *	PORTC 8 bits of Data
 *	PORTA bit 4 - E clock

That is correct, the LCD is NOT memory mapped, it is connected
directly to the pins on the 68HC11 that become ports A, B, and C
in "single chip" mode.

That is correct.
Something like:
	Write B
	Write C (this is your data)
	Write the clock high
	NOP
	Write the clock low
(The NOP is to insure the timing requirements of the LCD are met,
you can leave it out but it can screw up when the LCD is cold)

Not exactly, it means the SRAM is unavailable to you when you are
in single chip mode, however there is at least 256 bytes of RAM
addressed at address 0 that is available (its inside the
processor). It's not "kinda" weird, it is very, very weird. 
 
> Anything else you can point me to as far as addressing the LCD and

Other than the source I sent out? Not really. Note that you can't
address SRAM easily in single chip mode. I suspect it is possible
but it is much easier to copy stuff from SRAM into the first 256
bytes before you switch into single chip mode.

Wierd:

Anyway I have some kind of problem with the handyboard.  All steps up 
to the testing of the LCD went fine.

When I plugged in the LCD and turned it on, it lights up (one line) 
bright not dim.  I tried to download the pcode_hb.s19 with config set 
to 0C.  It appeared to download but:

I did not get any sound AND the LCD does not change AND I get an 
error stating, "Invalid CONFIG reg (0xFF) try again".  If I read this 
error correctly, it is suggesting that the configuration reg could 
not be changed.

I have checked the orientation and soldering of each chip and the 
LCD connector.  All is fine.  I have also written a small ASSM test 
program and verified that it downloads and executes. 

I am using an equivelant LCD (DCM16249) listed on handyboard web.
I am using a 68HC811E2 but this should not be a problem since the 
EEPROM is disabled.

Any clues as to what the problem might be?

Chuck,

You said you sent out some driver code (LCD I assume).  Is is an 
assem driver?  Where is it?

I found the driver you sent earlier.  Thanks.  BTW, I found out that 
my LCD is good but I still have a problem.

It appears that I cannot change my CONFIG reg.  Maybe because it is 
an 811E2; don't know.  Should be able to however.

Since the program was complaining about not being able to change the 
CONFIG and reporting that it was invalid at 0xFF, I used that value 
to trick the program (hbdl).  It worked as far as getting passed the 
check.  It downloaded the program and the IC display came up on the 
display.

Now, my problem is why can't I change the CONFIG reg?
What is the CONFIG of my MCU?

A 0xFF in CONFIG seems to have EEPROM at F800, which overlaps the 
SRAM.  The CONFIG reg should be set to maybe 0x2E but it won't 
change.

Does anyone have a solution for this?  Do I now have 32K - 2K of SRAM 
and 2K of EEPROM?  Is that a problem?  Any suggestions?

Howdy All,

I am in a happy mood today. I finally got to the 'hello world' stage.

All I had to do was count the number of interrupts, * 2 (16 bit addresses), 
subtract this from BFFF which is the reset vector and thus supply BFD6 to 
my linker to start its vector table.

I learned a lot from the responses people gave me, thanks ! I came to a 
solution by taking the time and actively looking for a solution using the 
tools I have.  Yes I am proud today.

Using the following code;

@port volatile unsigned char MOTOR @0x7000;
void main ()
{
	int i,j;
	while (1) {
		for (i=0;i<=255;i++) {
 			MOTOR= i;
			for (j=0;j<4000;j++) {
				_asm("nop\n");
			}
		}
	}
}

I managed to make my motor leds flicker,
the @0x7000 is a efficient way to use memory mapped peripherals
the included NOP instruction was just to slow things down and to try the 
so-called in-line assembly.
After creating big database applications for companies I am as happy as a 
kid with my Christmas lighting.

QUESTION - Why can the whole memory range from 7000 - 7fff be used to set 
the motor drivers or to fetch the digital input signals?

thanks everybody,
I'll continue my quest ...

Jaron

This was done (obviously) to save extra decoding circuitry needed on 
the board.

That is, if the handy board needed to assign (say) 7000 as the motor 
then sixteen address lines need to be decoded (binary 0111 000 000 
000).
Yet with the address of 7000 - 7FFF, only the first four bits 
(binary 0111 = 7) need to be decoded.

This is essentially wasteful in memory locations, yet with plently of 
address space this is not really a problem.

Recently, many of you have had pretty specific hardware-related questions.
The best thing to do is to read Appendix B of the MIT 6.270 Robot Builder's
Guide (Appendix A of the new 1998 Course Notes).  This appendix contains a
complete description of the 6.270 hardware.  "Nearly all of the technical
discussion translates directly into an explanation of how the Handy Board
works."  The software describes the memory mapping of output and input
devices (using Y0-Y5, multiplexing w/ a '374), the motor drivers, analog
inputs, serial communication, IR recv/xmit, etc.  The information presented
in the Appendix is invaluable for both tinkerers and the curious.

I have a 266 G3 minitower, and I have the identical problem.  The only way

 hello,
i was wondering if anyone can help me.i dont own a handyboard yet,  how do you
program it, i am worried that it is very compicated to do. please if you could
send me some simple code say to move both drive motors fwd, how would you do
it?
 i am just trying to get a feel for it so i can decide if the handyboard is
for me, also where do i get one with motors sensors etc...
thanks -mike

Actually, the frequency is somewhat important.  The faster you switch,
the more power will be lost to the switching of the power transistors
and the filtering effect provided by the inductance of the motor.  At
the other extreme, frequencies that are too slow will cause the motor to
run sporadically instead of smoothly.  For the motors I'm using I ran an
experiment of controlling the motors with a constant power ratio and a
variable frequency, and found that the optimum frequency was around
30Hz.  Of course, that number is entirely dependent on the motor design;
smaller motors will need faster frequencies; larger motors will probably
do better with slower frequencies.

Mike,

Chuck McManis may have answered your request, but in case you still 
want sample code I am attaching an example code that prints to the 
HandyBoard display.
(The code forms part of the Handy Board buffalo I had developed).

I had trouble getting the display working as well.
The main problems were:

1.  In single line display, the display is to dark to read.
     Putting the display in two line, allowed the writing on the 
     display to be read. 

2.  You first need to send a 'Display On' code to the display, 
     before any future writes to the display will work.

Mike,

>  hi i am looking for a handyboard, i saw one at trinity college it

The best place for all information about the handy board, including 
the places to buy, is the Handy Board Home page.

http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/Projects/handy-board/index.html

To get directly to the page on where to buy them, then go here:

http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/Projects/handy-board/howtoget/i
ndex.html

We (at the Uni) purchased ours from

                        Patrick Hui, based in Hong Kong, offers Handy
                        Board kits and assembled systems.

Programming the HandyBoard is very simple.  Not much effort at all.
The information received from the Handy Board explains how to program 
it.
As for sample code, it depends on how you intend to program it.
You can program in C, or you can program in machine code.

It is best to possible obtain a Handy board first, then try 
programming.

Look up "Handy Board" on the internet.
It will be the first hit on the search usually.

You can write "Interactive C" (IC) programs on a PC/Mac and download it
into the HB. IC is like C but alot less complicated.  If you know C, it is
pretty simple.  If you don't know C, it is just simple.

You can also write Assembler which is a little harder.  But you only need
this if you want to do some fancy stuff.

To make the motors go forward, you use the statements:

fd(0);
fd(1); 

for motor 0 and 1, respectively.

You can get a motors and sensors beginner pack from "Gleason Electronics",
where you will get your Handy Board from too.

you should charge a lead acid battery which is between 10% and 90% charged
at a rate of Capacity/10. In this case the rate would be 0.2 amps.  when
the battery is either almost charged (>90% charged) or almost depleted
(<10% charged) the rate shoud be Capacity/20 because the internal
resistance of the cells makes the battery less efficient at these times. 
(paraphrased from "The Complete Battery Book", by Richard A. Perez, p26.)

Hello Community,

I would like to enter the "World of HandyBoard" and I'm searching for a
Distributor in Germany (or some people who know how to get one in
Germany). I would buy it in every state: ready-made, kit and PCB only.

Is there a community of HandyBoard-Useres in Germany?

Thanks in advance, Have Fun

Kai Glaesner

   Go to Handy Board WEB page and look under "Get One". You
   will see all kind of info of how to get one including bare PC board

Hallo Kai,

da ich ebenfalls aus Deutschland komme, habe ich vor einiger Zeit das
gleiche Problem gehabt. In Deutschland wird nach meinem Wissen lediglich
das Rug-Warrior Bord vertreiben (=FCber Joker-Robotics). Ich habe mein HB=
 in
den Staten gekauft, das hat sehr gut funktioniert

Ich schau mal nach bei wem ich den Bausatz gekauft habe.

Tschau

Help:

We have had five boards go bad after charging of the battery.  These
boards passed all of the tests and functioned perfectly.  However after
the batteries were first discharged then recharged we get nothing on the
screen.  pcode appears to load fine, but then no beep and nothing on the
LCD.

if(analog(0) < 240)
{
blah blah blah
}

analog(0) is the analog sensor 0 on the HB and 
240 is like 4.7V
240/255*5.0V = 4.7V

Subject: how do I build my own pcode?
X-Priority: 3 (Normal)

Title says it really.

I am using both IC2.8something and IC3.2. I would like to make some
small changes to the pcode for these to allow other LCDs and so on.
(one goal would be to do without the LCD if I wanted to)

I would rather work in a DOS/Windows environment but could use linux if
I had to.

Can anyone tell me exactly what I need to have and what I need to do to
build my own pcode for the board.

Many thanks

You can pick up the pcode source from the MIT web site at 
http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/pcode_p
c.zip

This file contains the source code for 2.8 pcode with instructions on how
to re-compile under msd*s.

I have modified the source to use larger/smaller LCD displays,  although
they need to be ones that use the Hitachi HD44780 chipset.  

IC 3.x source code is available from ftp://newtonlabs.com/contrib/  
This is the version that has the new smooth-pwm motor drivers. 

The Un*x version of the source is also available somewhere in
ftp://cherupakha.media.mit.edu/pub/projects/6270/interactive-c

Subject: HandyBoard 10-16 Servo support
X-Priority: 3 (Normal)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I am trying to develop simple Hardware/Software to support up to 16 servos from
the HandyBoard.
A theoretical constraint of my plans is that only about 10 of the 16 connected
servos will be able to actively hold position at one time.

I plan to do this by multiplexing control signals for all of the servos onto one
timer output line such as TOC3 or TOC4 which are available on the expansion
port.

This requires some demultiplexing hardware, and I have a tentative schematic to
do this which uses a 73HC374 (for additional digital outs) and a 73HC154 (for
the de-multiplexing).

Being a hardware novice, my question/problem is this:  the 73HC154 demultiplexor
provides "active-low" outputs in that all non-selected output lines are high
rather than low as the servo's require.  To use this chip then I will have to
add 16 inverters which seems a waste.

Is there a different demultiplexor that I can use to get "active-high" outputs
to avoid the requirement of all the inverters?

Thanks,
/Max


PS:  what does the HC in the middle of things like 73HC374 mean?  How does it
compare to things like 73LS374?  Should all components on an HB expansion board
be of the HC type?

"HC" is for CMOS chips
"LS" is for Low-Power Schottky chips

Hi All,
   Has anyone noticed that if you slightly modify Julian Skidmore's LIB_HB.C
code that one can get 256 motor power levels rather than 100? I took the
following code in LIB_HB.C:

void motor(int m, int speed)
{
  if (speed>100) speed=100;
  if (speed<-100) speed=-100;
  if (speed >= 0)
    _set_motor(m, 0, (255*speed)/100);
  else
    _set_motor(m, 1, (-255*speed)/100);
}


And then changed the code to the following:


void motor(int m, int speed)
{
  if (speed>255) speed=255;
  if (speed<-255) speed=-255;
  if (speed >= 0)
    _set_motor(m, 0, speed);
  else
    _set_motor(m, 1,(-1*speed));
}

I can now get 256 power levels rather than the previous 100. I have
tested it (but not extensively) and it seems to work OK. Any comments on
this would be appreciated.

Hi Paul,

    You can visit Handy Board WEB and look under "Get One" . Pick component
    button under "Get One" you will see a couple of places that have L293D.

I need to bring my IC 3.2 program to another computer.

Do I need to reinstall the files from the original execuatble?

Or can I just zip up my IC directory and unzip it on another computer?

I used the MC34064 in both of the handyboards that I built.

WARNING !! The pin out the DS1233 and MC34064 is DIFFERENT! You need to
rotate the MC34064 by 120 degrees. Check the pin out before inserting
the MC34064. If you do not rotate it, the Handyboard will not work
correctly and the 34064 will get very hot. When I built my boards I
inserted the 34064 directly into the DS1233 holes. It took me 3 days to
find the problem.

Hello, I am multiplexing 5 LED displays through the Handy Board, but I
am getting excessive flicker as in the brightness of the displays is not
constant...the intensity of the displays varies from time to time. Does
anyone, then, have a program to multitask the multiplexing routine? The
whole program is attached here.

Thanks!

No it's actually quite easy, the only thing is you have to do a lot of soldering.
Be careful of the HC373 which is mounted directly onto the board as if it is
damaged by heat, then you will have a "nice" time desoldering it...
To drive both forward, all you need to do is:

void BothForward() {
  fd(0);
  fd(1);
}
This will drive the motors on outputs 1 and 2 forward. Why don't you go download
the manual?

Priority: normal

Is there some documentation somewhere that shows the commands 
required to talk to the display.  I would like to control the display 
from assembly code and I need to know what these commands are.

I already know how to talk to the display using the A, B, C ports but 
there must be some commands and data that need to be sent to the LCD.

Thanks

This is one of the many FAQ's on the net for LCD's.

Or goto Hitachi web site and look at the actual data sheet info

I use the Siemens SFH506-36 instead of the Sharp, and it works just fine. I
know there also is another compenent you can use, but I don't know the name
of it anymore, sorry. Perhaps if Maarten Emke reads this, he knows what I
mean.
Be carefull by the way, the pin lay-out is different:

Sharp IS1U60
1: out
2: gnd
3: vcc

Siemens SFH506-36
1: gnd
2: vcc
3: out

Thanks to Maarten Emke again for this info.

Hope this helps,

Hi

The LCD display is driven by a HD44780 Controller.
Download the docs..

or check the following page

Mike,

I never goes into expanded mode! The Handyboard operates in special test mode
and special bootstrap mode. Special test mode works like expanded mode but some
the internal registers are not protected.

Mike,

I used PCBUG11 to test my handyboards. The reason that you can not access the
SRAM is that PCBUG11 boots single-chip mode and there is not external bus. You
need change HPRIO from $85 to $A5.

Subject: "Undocumented I-C"
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Well I finally worked out something that I knew was there, but did not know
how to access: The PCODE.ASM file lists a pcode routine called "Pbench".
The code is in there, and it measures the time available to the IC current
task, excluding time stolen by interrupts executing (mainly the TOC4-1000Hz
system tick).  Not finding how to call it from Interactive C, I wrote my
own equivalent version some time ago as an ICB assembler routine, and I
used it a lot myself.

Now last night I downloaded the V2.8... IC unix sources from the handyboard
site at MIT, and the use of PBENCH is revealed.

But secret #1: To a knowledgeable WIN hacker, but a Unix ignoramus, how to
fetch the UNIX archive stuff to a WIN machine? Netscape allowed me to
download the files: names like this:  "......286...beta_tar.Z".  But
Netscape renamed them while saving: like this: "....beta_tar.tar".
WINZIP32 (recent version) thought it could extract from this, but it
started, then gave up with a "0 records" error.  So I renamed them back to
the original names: like this: "....beta_tar.Z".  Now Winzip tackled these
files OK (but in a double-stage mode I had not seen before on the familiar
ZIP files).  I got a whole directory full of C H PRO LEX and other files
from the original unix source.  Hog Heaven!

I gather that the TAR is the archiving of the whole directory structure up
as a bundle, and the Z is the compression function.  And fortunately the
newer WINZIP has enough smarts to undo both stages for me.

Secret #2:  I found Pbench function tied to a token called BENCHMARK with a
syntax in Interactive-C of:
    _benchmark()
So I fired up my H-B and I-C, typed in "_benchmark();" and IT WORKED:  it
returned 1467 or something like that, varying a bit on each invocation.
It means: the number of CPU clock cycles (out of 2000) devoted to PCODE/IC
current task in one tick cycle (between successive tiks).  The missing
(2000-1467 = 533) cycles are consumed by interrupt routine functions: tic,
infrared RX, RTI if you are using it, etc.

Secret #3: There are other internal keywords in there that I dont know the
use of, like WHENEVER.  Maybe they are strictly internal, not for use by
the user?

Secret #4: I now actually use commercial IC3.2 windows IDE version - and I
wouldn't go back to old 2.86 Dos-line one.  But my PCODE.ASM / PCODE_HB.S19
are my own VERY heavily worked-over variant of PCODE.ASM V2.86.  Are they
compatible, IC3.2 with pcode 2.86?  Initially, no.  IC3.2 objected to the
pcode version number 2.86.  Obviously this is checked by IC as it starts
up.  So I altered the "version number" near the end of PCODE.ASM to read
3.10, and recompiled the PCODE.S19.  That works fine.  But was I sure that
the PCODE token table (and the code routines behind each token) were
unchanged from V2.86?   Still checking - but I think it may be untouched.
Certainly I have had no strange behaviour from my "mixed" system that might
suggest conflicting use of pcode interpreter functions.  And certainly the
token table (I think it is at 0xC100 from memory?) is just the same length
as before when I inspect the S19 files of 2.86 versus 3.1.  Anyone know for
sure?

Is it possible to buy individual legos that are not normally sold
individually? For exaple, the pneumatic parts are advertised as being sold
seperately. But several sets have an air compression chamber that is not
advertized as being available to be individually sold. Is there any way I
can order just one of these, short of buying the whole set that contains the
compression chamber?

The air compressor (the one meant to be driven by a motor) is offered in the
Lego Shop At Home Spring '98 catalog as part #5117, $4.00, and it comes with
a few pulley wheels.  Often, even if they don't mention it in their current
catalog, if you have the part number they can get it for you.  If you're
looking for the hand operated air pump instead, that one is part #5107, $3.25.

Another source for Lego Technics is the Pitsco Dacta catalog.  You can call
them at 1-800-362-4308.  Be sure to compare prices, though, because
sometimes there are huge differences in price between the two companies.

The first step is to install Acrobat Reader per the instructions that come
with it.  Sounds like you've done that.  The next step (provided you have a
PC running Windows) is to go to the appropriate web page and right-click on
the link for the HB manual.  A context menu pops up, at which point you
choose "Save Link" (or "Save As" or whatever it is), and select a folder.
After the file is downloaded, you simply double-click on it in Windows
Explorer.  That ought to start Acrobat Reader automatically.  Good luck.

Thanks, I'll try this.  I did finally realize that the HandyBoard is 
not supposed to boot to expanded mode.

Thanks again.

I have those docs.  I knew that it was driven by the hd44780 but the 
summary page on their web site indicated that the 44780 could drive 2 
lines of 8 characters and I assumed there must be a micro on the 
board to handle the 2x16 and that there might be some other command 
set other than the 44780.

Anyway I now have the docs.

thanks,

Look at http://www.iaehv.nl/users/pouweha/ for all the information that you
ever want to know about LCDs : how to interface, how to control, sample
source code and all commands.

You probably mean the Sharp GP1U5x. That one is modifiable so that it can
be read like an analog signal.

If anyone can direct me to a company in the Netherlands which sells these
parts, I would very much like to know. Thanks.

Hi

I built a small circular robot base with differential steering using 3" =
diameter rubber wheels and optical encoders on both wheels.
The motors powering the robot are high efficiency German built gear =
motors using 300 mA when stalled, and rotating @ 60 RPM unloaded.
The encoders are home built reflective type producing 16 pulses/rev.
The robot is controlled by the Handy board using the smooth PWM Pcode.  =
The motors are powered by a 12V 3 Ah gel cell battery.

The problem is that one of the motors is 2 RPM slower than the other =
therefore the robot tends to drift toward the side of the slower motor.
I have a few ideas on how to accomplish this, but two heads are better =
than one, so I'm looking for some input to help me write an efficient =
program to keep the robot moving straight.
=20
Any Ideas are welcome.

Thanks=20

Laszlo Roska.

I handled this type of problem by creating a new process that simply
monitors motor speed settings and encoder counts (global variables), and
changes a speed setting in proportion to the difference between the encoder
counts of the two drive wheels.  There's a global speed setting for each
wheel, and a third global that represents the desired "throttle" setting.
To go forward in a perfectly straight line, simply change the throttle
value.  The monitor process periodically checks this throttle value and does
whatever is needed to achieve the desired encoder counts on each wheel.  It
also determines when a wheel is stalled.  My robot zigs a little bit at
first, and then tracks straight as an arrow.

Hi everyone.
I use a 4 bits binary counter to measure the no. of pulses emitted from
a shaft encoder(TTL output) in order to calulate the speed of a DC
motor. But i want to know what is the best frequency that the processor
should take the bit pattern from the counter?
what does it depends on?

Thank you for all your help.

I had exactly the same problem.  There is a CMOS chip by Motorola called
the MC14028B that is a BCD-to-decimal or Binary-to-octal decoder.  All
that really matters though is that it will take a 4-bit input and
decode up to *10* outputs that are *active high*.  I know it is not
16 as desired, but if you can live with just ten, it should suit you
fine.

Good luck, Skye.

The specs on the HB say it uses 9.6 volts. Is this a required voltage? or=
 can it be another rating as long as it is within the regulators limits. =
Basically I want to use 12 volt motors, but not at 9.6 volts. I am assumi=

Also, does anyone know what the minimum voltage which can be supplied is?

Subject: Shorted Handyboard
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Finishing mounting our handyboard to the chasis of our robot, we shorted
the board.  A screwdriver made contact near the IR reciever on the bottom
right corner of the board.  Additionally, the 2.5A fuse blew.

After this occured, we have not been able to get the board to work.  First,
when we turned in on, all the motor drivers turned on.  After this, we felt
we had blown the microprocessor and maybe the other chips so we ordered
them for replacements. 

When we replaced the HC11 chip and tried to download the code in bootstrap
mode, the motor drivers were no longer on, but after the pcode was
downloaded and the board turned off and on, the computer still didn't
recognize the board and prompted us to look for board and download the
pcode again.  Subsequently, we have replaced some of the other logic chips
but to no avail.  One chip we have not replaced is the SRAM.  Is this
something that we will need to replace?

As students, this is our first attempt with a microcontroller and we don't
know how to approach fixing this blown board. What other information do you
need?  What do we need to check on the board?  We can't download the code
so we have no idea what works.  

Thanks for your help.  Our due date is in 9 days, so we need help as soon
as possible.  Tell us what info you need or what to do so our board will
function again.

Hello.  Several questions.  What is the best way to charge the board? 
Through charger board or to teh board directly.  Also, when i am chanrging
it, am I charging the internal battery or the external NiCD batteries?  
Also, does the board have its own internal battery, or it is always getting
power from external NiCD or dc adapter.
I am using 12V DC adapter that supplies only 400mA, I hope that's OK.  Also,
when I try to hook up the adapter to the charger board, with handy board
atached in the off state and normal charge mode, without external NiCD
attached, the following occurs: all 4 red lights on motor drivers light up,
and so green power.  However, if I take out the lcd, then only one green
light on one motor driver lights up (along with green power).  Can anyone
give me a detailed procedure how to charge the internal battery of the
board, if I am not planing to use external NiCD at all.
Thank you

Hello.  I just got HB assembled and tested.  I do not have external NiCDs
connected, since I am going to be cutting the power lead and connecting an
alternative power source.  From what I understand there is an internal
battery that still needs to be charged.  When I plug DC adapter (12DC 400mA
center negative), to charger board, yellow light on chrger board lights up,
and then all red light on HB motor drivers light up, and LCD has upper row
of black squares, and then green "pow" lights up on HB as well (the one by
battery connectors).  Is that what is supposed to happen, or I am not even
supposed to be charging the board when external NiCDs are not connected? 
Then, if I cut power lead to use external power pack, what is goingto drive
the board itself? Thank you for all your help

I am using an 811E2 part in my handyboard with IC.  It is supposed to 
have problems with this chip.  I have not disabled the EEPROM but it 
still seems to work.

I have been having a problem finding the A1FN part.  I do not want to 
buy anymore of the 811E2 parts but I can find the E1FN part.  I would 
like to ask a question to those who have experience with these 
EEPROM parts.

I have been told that the 811E2 part will not work with IC because 
the EEPROM overlaps the SRAM. So, why does mine work?  What kind of 
problems can I expect by using this part?  The config reg. in this 
part, apparently, gets reset back to the original location after 
every reset.  I would like to move the EEPROM to some other location, 
maybe 2000Hex to make my handyboard completely compatible.  How can I 
do this if the config reg is continually reset?  What specific?

Assuming the E1 is a better part than the 811E2 for the 
handyboard,...

How compatible is the E1FN (512 EEPROM) part with the handyboard? 
What specifically is required to get it to work?

Does anyone know what typical Pad/Hole Widths are for thru-hole

Is there a web site for PCB geometry sizes that someone could point

Hi Mike

check with your board manufacturer for production specification.

The via hole size I resently used was 12mil with a via size of 16mil.

For Pad/Hole Width use the specifications of the parts you want to put
on your board.
A hole should be 8-10mil wider than the pin you want to put in.

Tom

Thanks,

I was going to use a pad/hole size of .050/.028.  The default size of 
my library uses .050/.025. 

I checked some pin size data and it shows .015 (min) to .023 (max).  
Allowing .008 to .010 extra and .003 for plating, it seems that the 
best size might be something more like .065 for the pad and .034-.036 
for the hole size.

Vias are a little less important.  I was going to use .040/.020 but 
that seems a little large.  

I checked the gerber files for then handyboard and they have only two 
hole sizes, in this range.  One is .028 and the other is .035.  I 
would assume the via hole is .028 and the pin hole is .035 (what I 
calculated).  I guess the via size is not so large after all.

Thanks

The Handy Board web site has a mail list archive page, from which you can
download archives of past postings.  The last item on the list is entitled
"Jan 1997 -- present" (which means it's probably huge).  Good luck.

Has anyone out there ever seen, heard about, or thought about the details of
electronic circuit built into a hobby servo motor to do the positioning and
maintaining the position based on the signal pulse sent? I am interested in
any information or schematics that could help me, at least academically, maybe
enough to build a DC motor control board that will interface just like a hobby
servo.

I am in the design phase of a walking robot and see the need for 3 different
size motors for each leg and have toyed with using regular DC motors. I would
like to offload the detailed control of these motors from the microcontroller
by interfacing them like a Futuba servo. This way the motor modules would be
plug and play "black boxes" and could be scaled to virtually any size without
the CPU knowing anything about it. This would also allow me to reduce or increase
gearing on any particular motor to adjust the speed or torque required.

I understand the use and need of the Pot for feedback but how can the length
of the signal pulse be translated into a useful signal that can be compared
to the output of the pot to indicate direction and need to move. (I do tend
toward the digital end of the spectrum but am trying to understand more of the
analog side)

Even if you don't have any details as to their operation, any brainstorming
tips would be appreciated.

Has anyone used the eltec 442-3 pyrometer with the Handyboard?? I am in the
process of using legos to build a robot, and have a completed 442-3
pyrometer with the lens and all that I got in.  I am looking for the best
way to wire this sensor, and I have also read that the same type of
programming in IC can be used for the photo resistors as the pyrometer....
The main application I have for the pyrometer is to locate or detect a lit
candle..

In addition I am also wondering what the best way would be to wire up two
IR emitters for left and right detection on the handyboard, however I know
that there is a socket already for an IR led, but wonder if I could hookup
two IR emitters.....

The other thing that I am wondering about is this, the photo resistors work
fine for detecting light/dark areas, (I have a pair of rug warrior pro
robots that do this now),  but they dont seem to be able to effectively
detect a lit candle, unless the area the robot is in is dark in general.
This is why I am hoping that the eltes 442-3 sensor would be a better
choice to detect a lit candle...



Any links/information GREATLY appreciated.

Ideally, I could use an H-bridge on the same board as the "new" electronics
and provide expanded feedback such as current sensing or encoder in addition
to the normal servo interface. It would also be nice to allow PWM to control
the power presented to the motor. The real clincher is understanding how to
turn the signal pulse length into something useful I can deal with and
compare to the output of an encoder or pot.

I've already thought through using an oscillator and counters with a oneshot
timer to generate continuous PWM by just having the CPU write to a couple of
memory locations that would be latched as control registers. This offloads
the PWM control from the CPU, except to establish parameters.

Hi all,

i have problems during download the new smooth-pwm routine into my

I had download the sourcecode and the zip file from internet. I get the

it possible to get an ICB-smooth-pwm-pcode ?

Thank=B4s for help

Hi all,

There has been a bug lurking in the Handy Board standard library files
since the dawn of time (well, 1996, when the HB got started).

The bug can happen when you are using multi-tasking, and more than one
IC task is performing analog sensor readings, or if you have loaded
drivers that may perform analog conversions (e.g., the shaft encoder
utilities).

In the subroutine in lib_hb.c which performs analog readings
(_raw_analog), it is possible for another process (either an IC
process or an assembly language driver) to interrupt the analog
conversion, in between the time when the analog channel is selected
and the result is read back.  If the interrupting process performs an
analog conversion of its own, when the interrupted subroutine gets
control back, it reports the later reading rather than the one it
started.

I've posted an updated version of the libraries that fix this problem.
A short assembly language driver performs the basic analog read
function.  Interrupts are disabled during the span between the
selecting the analog channel and reading the result.

I recommend that everyone download and install these new drivers.
Aside from fixing this intermittent bug, the new driver is faster and
smaller.

To download, please see the Handy Board home page:

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.


Fred

P.S.  Thanks to Ericson Mar and Rick Freuler for noticing and
reporting this problem.

Hi

The SPI Header is connected to port D of the hc11 as follows:

Port D Bit 2 - PD2 - MISO
Port D Bit 3 - PD3 - MOSI
Port D Bit 4 - PD4 - SCK
Port D Bit 5 - PD5 - SS

All of those pins can be used for general-purpose I/O signals.

To program port D you have the following registers:

* DDRD (Data Direction Register Port D) $1009
For output set the corresponding bit to 1.
All bits 0 (input) after reset.

* PORTD (POrt D Data) $1008
Read or Write data through this register.

* SPCR (Serial Peripheral Control) $1028
Make sure that the SPI is turned off.
Bit 7 and Bit 6 of this register must be cleared (0).
Bit 7 - SPI interrupt
Bit 6 - SPI enable

With bit 5 (DWOM) you can control the Port D mode
(Port D Wired-OR Mode option)
DWOM = 0 Normal CMOS outputs
DWOM = 1 Open-drain outputs

For further information about port D please refer to the HC11A8 technical
manual.
http://www.mcu.motsps.com/cgi-bin/Lit?Table=HC11&Type=USER

it's the pdf or ps file MC68HC11A8/D

Hope that helps.

Tom

Hi Arthur,
The SPI expansion header is shown below:

    ----------     Pinouts:    1    Gnd
    |  2  |  1  |                      2    Vcc 5V
    |  4  |  3  |                      3    SS*
    |  6  |  5  |                      4    MISO
    |  8  |  7  |                      5    SCK
    ----------                      6    MOSI
                                        7 & 8 Not connected

I assume you will be using the Handy Board as a MASTER device not a SLAVE so
the following information relates to the SPI MASTER mode.

Port D address is $1008

The SS* pin is connected to Port D5.  It is active low and is used to activate
the external device, like a chip select pin.

The MISO pin is connected to Port D2.  It is used to serially input data to
the SPI.  This pin should be connected to the Data Out of the external device.

The SCK pin is connected to Port D4.  It is used to clock the data from the
SPI data register into the external device via the MOSI pin.  As data is
outputted it is simultaneously inputted to the SPI data register from the
external device.  So after one 8bit transfer the SPI data register will
contain the output from the external device.  This pin should be connected to
the clock of the external device.

The MOSI pin is connected to Port D3.  It is used to serially output data from
the SPI.  This pin should be connected to the Data In of the external device.

You should set the DDRD ($1009) pins for I/O according to the function of the
SPI, ie the SCK (PD4) should be set for output using the DDRD.

The SPI control register ($1028) is used to set the configuration for the SPI,
bits are as follows:
7    SPI interrupt enable
6    SPI system enable (Must be set)
5    wired OR mode select, (Clear it, unless you know what it does)
4    Master/Slave select,  (Set for MASTER Mode)
3    Clock polarity (clear for SCK low idle)
2    Clock phase select (clear for most devices)
1,0 Bit rate (clear both for maximum transfer rate, E clock/2)

SPI status register ($1029) just shows flags of the current SPI status
bits are as follows:
7    SPI transfer complete flag
6    Write collision error flag, (set only if SPDR is written during a data
transfer)
5    Not used
4    Mode fault error flag, (Set if SS* is sent low by external device)
3,2,1,0 Not Used

The Most important register is the SPI data register ($102A).  This is where
you put your 8bit data block which you want sent through the SPI to the
external device.
After a transfer you can read this register to access the information sent
from the external device.

I hope this info has been helpful

Will this new lib_hb.c also replace the Smooth PWM lib_hb.c released
by Newton Labs?  It appears not.  What is the easiest way to consolidate
the Smooth PWM routines with your improved analog code?

Cheers, Skye.

You must manual consolidate the new driver with the smooth-pwm
libraries.

To consolidate, 

1.  edit the smooth-pwm lib_hb.c, and remove the function
"_raw_analog()",

2.  install the new lib_hb.icb file in your IC lib directory (this
contains the assembly-language replacement for _raw_analog), and

3.  add lib_hb.icb to your lib_hb.lis master library file.

I cannot find any spec. on neither of these LCD screen

Subject: setting the best PWM frequency for DC motor
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

hello everyone, I found some information on "How do I set best PWM
parameters for DC motors?" from the "Robotics Information" homepage, 
http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/robotics.html

and inside it described that in order to make current to flow steadily in
between pulses, you need to satisfy this condition:

2*pi*f*L >> R

where f = swithching frequency
	L = armature inductance
	R = armature resistance
and >> is much greater than

I am wondering why is this the case and how this will make the current to
flow steadily?? I could not found the reference book where this infomation
is come from, so does anyone know anything about this and explain to me
please?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=euc-kr

Hi!
 
   The handy board was working good before
   and I haven't used the board for a while.
   Recently, I ran the downloader few times,
   but I couldn't download the bootstrap.
   I think the download mode is ready, but
   the error message like "Board not Responding"
   is repeating(I know the downloading procedure).
   I believe there must be something wrong on chips.
 
   I remember one time I got a short around the reset
   switch while I was measuring the current. I still
   wonder why a short was made on the reset switch.
   There was a confusing  LCD readout like blinking
   few times. Since that time, I could use it without
   any trouble till now.
 
    1. Any possible way to check that some chips are
       not properly functioning?
    2. If U1 is wrong, any handy source for
       purchasing U1?
 
   Best Rerards,
 
   Mark

The most probable cause of this is a dead 6811. (it spoils rather easily...
:(Because everytime i have a problem with the board, it turns out to be
nothing more than a shot 6811. Even replacing the 7805 with a LM2931T kills
it.

Subject: Pad sizes and hole sizes
Priority: normal

I'm working on a board and I would like to avoid much trial and 
error.  I have read much on selection of pad sizes/via sizes and 
hole sizes but there seems to be some contridiction.

Does anyone know what the pad sizes (for ICs), hole sizes (for ICs) 
and via size/hole size, used on the handy board.  This would be a 
good starting point.

I have looked at the gerber files and it looks like:

Pad sizes: .060
Hole size: .035
Via size: .050
via hole size: .028

But looking at the board, the sizes seem smaller than the sizes in 
the gerber files.  For instance, the via sizes look like they can 
easily fit between pads on the ICs.  If pad sizes were .060 on ICs, 
then the space between them should be .04 and a via would be 10mils 
larger than that space.  But they appear to easily fit between them.

Does anyone know what the actual pad/hole sizes are for IC pads and 
vias?  I have asked Fred but it may take some time before he can get 
back to me on this.

Thanks

Does anyone have any experience with any of the Lego technic systems.  I am
looking for a car/truck that has motors (or can add motors to), has enough
room for a handyboard, and has the rack and pinion steering.  I would also
need a servo for the steering, but I haven't found a "lego servo" and I
want that clean look.

Also, has anyone made a snazzy enclosure for the hb using legos, or should
I just glue some to the existing case?

Thanks for you input.

Subject: Pyroelectric Sensor
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

 Hello. I have working with a handyboard, and I am trying to obtain 
 information on how to properly use a eltec 442-3 pyroelectric sensor. I 
 bought a complete one with a lens. My objective is for my lego robot to 
 locate either a flame or heat source, and right now I have it hooked up to 
 analog port 0. I had seen in the older version of  lib_hb,c, something 
 to the effect of a left and right pyro, however the recent versions of the 
 lib_hb.c do not seem to have anything like that. 
 
 The other question I am trying to figure out is that the eltec 442-3 has 
 four wires, one is ground, +5 volts, the signal, and a 2.5v reference. I 
 have not hooked up the 2.5v reference wire, however I thought I had read 
 something to the effect that it was not used, which I think I am wrong. IF 
 I do have to hook up the 2.5v reference wire, what's the best way to do 
 this??? Would you possibly have the drivers for the pyro sensors?????? 
 
 I know that right now, with IC 3.2, if I do a reading by typing analog(0);, 
 the values do not seem very stable, however when I put a candle about a 
 foot away from it, the analog(0) reading goes down to 6-10, after a little 
 but however, it does change by up to as much as 126.. 


 
 Any direction would be greatly appreciated.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi,

I am trying to install the polaroid 6500.
I use the schematics I found with the sonar.c file at this site.
It doesn't work, I dont understand the Motor power connection why does
it have 4 pins ?
One motor only uses 3 pins ?
I think the sonar device doesnt get enough voltage, I only measure
around 0.5 volts ?
Does the striped side of the ribbon-cable goes in number 1 of the socket
on the polaroid board ? (etc. etc.).

Who can help me and give me some tips and tricks ?

I really want to see this thing working !

Thanks,

Jan Luijk.

The two on the left are + battery voltage and the two on the right are
ground.  They're doubled up to handle more current, I guess.

Make sure that you're getting 9.6 V at the motor power header, and that
you have your six diodes (to drop the voltage from 9.6 V down to 6.0 V)
wired up with the correct polarity.

The two ribbon cables that I got with my pair of sonar modules had the
stripes wrong (one had the stripe on the pin 1 conductor and the other
on pin 9), so you should check that yours are hooked up correctly
regardless of the stripe.  With the cable coming straight up out of the
sonar module, make sure the shape of the plug matches the shape of the
footprint of the board connector J1 (i.e., four pins on the top and five
pins on the bottom, when the board is viewed "right side up" relative to
the printing on it).

Note:  I'm not an authority on sonar; I haven't gotten mine to work yet,
either.  Good luck.

Hello all,  

I am using neural nets to control my robot, and currently have to 
download the weights to the handyboard every time I power on.  This is 
a perfect application for using persistent global variables, but alas 
I am having troubles.  

My smallest network consists of 21 floats (84 bytes), but if I try to 
make more than 14 or 15 floats (56-60 bytes) persistent (it seems to 
depend on whether they are arrays or not) I get the friendly message 
"Board Syncronization Error", which I interpret as "Out of Persistent 
Global Space."

Does anybody know the size of this persistent global space?  If indeed
it is about 60 bytes, are there any known workarounds?  (e.g. can I
write the weights to an unused part of RAM and somehow grab the values 
when I start up?)

Cheers, Skye.

Hi !

I am searching for the data sheet of a TI speechprocessor TMS3477 (I
have the board of a little speech recorder with 90 seconds capacity and
max. 16 speech segments with this chip and I will try to connect this
board to the Handy Board for a Rug Warrior with speech capability).  Any
help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Erwin

Are there any performance differences to the HB if you run it on 7.2 volt=

 regulates anything from 6-18 volts down to the 5 volts for the circuit. =

I personally use a single 12 V 3Ah Gell cell to power my entire robot.
I'm using the 7805 with a heat sink and works just fine.

Hi,

I'd like to use two hacked servos _with_ servoelectronic for a Rug
Warrior like robot controlled with a HB. Now I am searching for motor
driver functions for IC 3.2 to control the servos via the standard motor
functions (i.e. fd(), bk(), and so on). Can anyone help me ?

<SNIP>

        My understanding is that 7.2V will work fine.  I suspect 9.6V is
used simply because 8 AA NiCd's fit so well in the specified box.  
        The chief concerns here are: (1) do you have enough voltage overhead
for the 7805; and (2) can you draw enough (instantaneous) current for your
motors?  This is not a question of capacity (mah), just amps.
        Unless your motors are small and VERY efficient, I believe Lithium
cells won't work.  I don't know about NiMH; you'll have to check the specs.
Remember, motors can pull big currents when stalled or under load.

   I believe the 9.6 volt also makes a good match for
   most LEGO motors.

Hi all,

Did anybody see my previous questions about polaroid 6500 ?
(except for Will, thanks):

> I am trying to install the polaroid 6500.

Can I use the motor(3,75) statement to create enough voltage ?

I think my polaroid board is damaged, how can I know for sure ?

How can I repair it ?

Which chip is most likely to be damaged ?

Thank you in advance for any comment !!

I assume that I have some dated software?? can anyone help me with
this problem?
I also need to know which value R4, the preision resistor should
be.  The parts list calls for 2.94k, while the assembly and the
schematic calls for 3.93k.
I did a search on both of the above problems in the archives but did
not get any hits.=20

your Interactive C is not loading the correct libraries.  Make sure IC
is configured to load lib_hb.lis, NOT lib_r22.lis.  Get the latest
lib_hb.c, lib_hb.lis, and lib_hb.icb from the Software resources area
of the HB web site.

The correct value is 3.93k.  Where exactly do you still see 2.94K?
This should have been expunged.

i have been trying to get the pcode_hb.s19 file downloaded to the handyboard,
and the farthest that i got was the file downloaded (using 'dl' and 'dlm'
downlloaders) but then the PC couldnt synchronize with the handyboard.  i have
a series 'a' board, and am using DOS.  when i go ahead and try to use IC even
though the file has not downloaded properly, by first turning the board off,
then turning it back on, nothing but an all black strip comes on on the top
row of the display, and nothing on the bottom row, not the interactive C
welcome that is described in the literature.  as for what happens when i try
to run the program(IC), the program tries to connect to the board, but it says
that the board is not responding.  for some reason the program can succesfully
download the file to the board, but not communicate with it to accomplish any
other functions.  any suggestions?

The reason the board is not responding seems to be because the downloader=
 is sending data to the wrong COM port. Find out whether you are using CO=
M1 or COM2 and then check your downloader and IC as well to confirm you a=
re on the right port.

from the DOS prompt type:

dl -config

~then hit {enter} until the port selection comes up. (you can type either=
 com1 or com2, type the correct one.
continue to hit enter until you have exited the config mode.

next type:

ic -config

~go through the same steps as the downloader config.
your downloader should now send to the correct port. IC should also recog=
nize the board now too.

hope this helps.

i am still having trouble with getting the PC to communicate with the
handyboard.  all conections seem to be correct, and the programs are
configured correctly, but the thing will still not communicate properly.
mabye there is a fault in the board itself, i am wondering what the screen
should display in the bootstrap mode, i have a dark black bar in the top line,
and nothing in the bottom.  this is also what is on screen when the board is
"on".  is this correct?  also, in any mode, the four red lights are on
indicating a motor direction.  should these be on during bootstrap mode?
during download with "dl", the program downloads with no trouble, "dl" seems
happy about what happens, but then when "trying to synchronize" does not work,
it returns "failed".  this has been as far as i got.  to check the board, i
tried to design a small assembler program that would use an XIRQ ISR to jmp to
a line of code on the zero page to drive port B pins hi, but it would not
download either.  my concern, and opinion, is that i have a malfunctioning
board.  please help.  thank you.

The motor state is insignificant before the board has booted.  I.e.,
the fact the motors are on the red direction means nothing; it's just
the random state of the motor output latch when the board turns on
without a program.

The LCD screen should not have a solid black band, however.  This
usually indicates a power problem.  Check that you have a legitmate
+5v on your board's power ckt.

Also, you should see the following LED behavior:

1. before download:  BATT and PWR LEDs fully off
2. during download:  PWR LED flashes
3. after download:   PWR LED on steady

If (1) is not true, then your board is not in download mode.  Download
cannot proceed until the board is powered on with both of these LEDs off.

If (2) is not true, then your board is not receiving data from your
PC.  Check your interface board power, serial cable, and telephone cable.

If (3) is not true, then something else indeterminate went wrong.

Thanks Adam,(adam@programmer.net) The Speed of the
A/D inproved by about 50 HZ, by getting rid of =

float types, so now I can sample data at 290HZ only!.
According to the Motorola "Pink Book" the A/D
should be ready after 32 E clock cycles and
the E clock is 2 MHZ, so the sampling should be =

good for 58KHZ and the nyquest is 29KHZ.

Can someone give me the info on the robot lawnmower mailing list?  As I
recall they split off with their own list a while back, but I didn't
follow to the new list.

There are some developments in Differential GPS that they should probably
be made aware of. Because some of you might be interested as well, here's
a quick summary:

1) The government is planning on implementing DGPS transmitters across the
contiguous 48 states very soon.  We have coverage of most of Washington
and Oregon now.

2) There are some cheap DGPS receiver designs on the net that work well.
See my home pages at http://www.eskimo.com/~archer and click on the GPS
link.  Rich Heineck's design has been updated (although my link text may
not state so yet), and Jim Bixby has a new design out which looks nice as
well.

3) TAPR has a way to convert an OEM GPS unit into a completely functioning
corrections generator that would allow you to create your own DGPS
correction station (with potentially more accuracy than the US Coast Guard
setup).  I think their link is http://www.tapr.org

Anybody know if the lawnmower list is still going?  I would be interested
in what their progress has been.  Maybe archives are available (I know,
I'm asking for too much!).

HELLO,
    MY NAME IS CHRIS RHODES AND I AM CONFUSED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A SERVO MOTOR AND A DC MOTOR.  THE HANDYBOARD LITERATURE SAYS
THERE ARE THE 4 DC MOTOR OUTPUTS AND 1 DIGITAL INPUT THAT CAN USED AS A
SERVO OUTPUT.  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN HOW YOU DRIVE THE DIFFERENT
MOTORS.  ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  THANK YOU

I interfaced 3 infrared optosensors to the digital inputs on the handyboa=
rd. I'm a little dissapointed in their performance however. The only time=
 they give a reading of "true" is if they are about a half an inch or clo=
ser from the target. Any further away than half an inch results in a "fal=
se" reading because the sensors are out of range.

Is there any way at all to have a bigger range. I want to have the sensor=
s 2 inches away from what they are to detect. If anyone has been using th=
e optosensors I'd like a little input.

-Should I use smaller resistors on the sensors?

-Is the range short because of how fast the digital(); function checks th=
e sensor? If it took longer to check would it then give the sensor more t=
ime to let the infrared beam to reflect back?

-Do I need stronger optosensors all together?
( I'm using the Quality Tech. 1114, as shown in the HB manual )

Thanks in advance,

Hi all,

i have problems during download the new smooth-pwm routine into my
handyboard. All times my downloader stopped
after few seconds with an error message "EOF after 1xxx Bytes ....."

I=B4m using a macintosh (PPC 4400) and use the 6811 download utility. Is
it possible to get an ICB-smooth-pwm-pcode ?

Thank=B4s for help

bye Bernd Klein

Hi Brian,

    I believe you are trying to implement the proximity sensor for object
avoidance
    or collision avoidance, correct ? I believe the QT1114 is designed for
the range the you
    have found. The spec. of the part also indicate the very near range
about 1/4 inch. 
    I have found similar result.  Try the IR detector that is used for
remote control. You can
    get one from Radio Shack, the one that is in the can and has 3 pins
behind
    the can.  With this detector, the IR Tx must be OSC about 38k-40k Hz.
You
    can adjust the range by varying the freq. around. 

    Here is info on IR detector:

Regards,
-Pandit

1/2" is actually pretty good range for a basic reflectance sensor.
try using them in the analog inputs -- you should get readings that
let you read out to about 1".

to get better than that, you need a modulated signal, like Pandit has
described.

I've had pretty good luck getting up to around 2" by using a standard IR
LED and standard IR phototransistor, modulating the IR LED in software,
and looking at the analog value returned from the phototransistor like
so:

{
  int refl;
  led_on();  refl +=3D analog(1);  led_off();  refl -=3D analog(1);
  led_on();  refl +=3D analog(1);  led_off();  refl -=3D analog(1);
  led_on();  refl +=3D analog(1);  led_off();  refl -=3D analog(1);
  printf("Reflectance is %d\n", refl);
}

You want to use a high-powered IR LED and put around 100 ma through it.

There were two enthusiasts who did hacks on the Radio Shack Tape Measure,
Jonathan, back in February of 1994. Their names are Thomas Rowley and
Brian Van Mondfrans. Brian was at Thurston High School in the Puget Sound
area back then so you might find what you need by browsing the Seattle
Robotics Society web page....http://www.seattlerobotics.org/contact.html
Good luck and enjoy!

This subject has most probably been discussed numerous times but I'm kinda
new to this mailing list and the Handyboard so bare with me. What are the
pros and cons of using Lego motors to drive a robot project that I have in
mind ???, should I scrape this idea and go for servos ???

Any comments would be hugely appreciated.

One other quick question, are there any UK based Handyboard user groups???

Thanks in advance

That still does not tell me the difference between how they are diven.  For
instance, can you use the 4 motor ports to drive a servo motor?  If not why? Any
help appreciated.

i have a motor that is manufactured by lego, and has a 4 pin connector which
is in the shape of a lego block.  i am new to lego robots, so i do not know
what the various parts look like exactly.  the motor that i have is about
1.25" cube, and seems to be geared down slightly.  does anyone know if lego
manufactures DC motors that are geared down, or any DC motors at all, or just
servo motors.  i think that this is a servo, and i also need to find
literature for this device, as i do not have any.  can anyone help me identify
this device?  thanks for your help.

What you have is most likely a 9V DC motor, not a servo.  As far as I know, 
there is no such thing as a Lego servo motor.  The four-contact plug is a Lego 
standard that allows changing the polarity simply by rotating the plug 90 
degrees.  There are actually just two wires going to the motor.

There are two main types of 9V Lego Technic motor:  the old, non-geared style 
and the new gear motor.  (There are also the Technic micro-motor and various 
non-Technic motors, like the kind that come with the railroad sets).  The 
Technic gear motor has the contacts  recessed into the top and a slot for the 
wire also in the top.  The regular (non-gear) motor is a plain old rectangular 
block shape with the contacts on the bottom.

Both types of Lego Technic motor seem to be quite efficient and can be run 
directly from the HB without the need for a separate motor battery pack.  I 
think that the new gear motors are better than the old, block-shaped motors, 
mainly because they're more compact (require fewer external gears to achieve 
usable RPM) and probably more efficient, too.  At $18 or so, the new gear motor 
is about the least expensive gear motor you'll find.

I have been unable to find any specs on these motors, but then I haven't really 
looked for 'em.

As I've said, I think the new Lego Technic gear motors are a great deal.  They're inexpensive (about $18 each), they seem to 
be quite efficient, and they run well directly from the HB power supply.  If 
you're building your robot out of Legos (and maybe even if you're not), then I 
personally recommend the new Lego Technic gear motors.

If you do get servos, make sure they're the kind with the full circular gears, 
so that you can hack them for continuous rotation (I've heard that some of the 
smaller servos out there have partial gears).  Tower Hobbies has good prices 
(they're on the web).  Bear in mind that you might need a separate battery pack 
for the motors if they can't handle 9.6 V.

That did answer my question.  I am not familiar with servo motors, I
have only used plain DC motors.  I am also familiar with PWM.  I was
just unable to determine if the same PWM signal that drives plain DC
motors could also drive servo motors.  From what I understand a servo
motor and DC motor use PWM to control the speed, and if that is the case
I did not see the difference in using the same PWM signal that drives a
DC motor to also drive a servo motor.  Thank you for all of your help.
If I stated anything incorrectly in this paragraph please correct me.

If not : 1 is there another RW pcode that will run without the LCD? I usi=
ng the RW
pcode on my Fingerboard II with out the LCD and I think this may be an is=

Thanks.

For servo, there is a certain threshold duty cycle (say 50%) of the PWM
signal, where anything above this threshold will make it to run forward,
and less will make it to run backward. So, you still need to apply the PWM
even if the servo is not moving.
And this is because servo is originally used for moving at certain amount
of angle, once it is modified as a driving unit, that angular feedback
device within the servo will also be modified. And the detail of how it
works has somthing to do with the threshold duty cycle. Please correct me
if I am wrong, as I am also thinking about using dc motor or servo.

The nature of the PWM (pulse width modulation) is entirely different
for servo's vs. plain DC motors.

For a DC motor, it has a two wire connection.  All drive power is
supplied over these two wires -- think of a light bulb.  When you turn
on a DC motor, it just starts spinning round and round.  Most DC
motors are pretty fast, about 5000 RPM (revolutions per minute).

With the DC motor, pulse width modulation refers to the idea of
controlling the power level by STROBING THE POWER ON AND OFF.  The key
concept here is DUTY CYCLE -- the percentage of "on time" versus "off
time."  If the power is on only 1/2 of the time, the motor runs with
1/2 the power of its full-on operation.  

If you switch the power on and off fast enough, then it just seems
like the motor is running weaker -- there's no stuttering.  This is
what PWM means when referring to DC motors.  The Handy Board's DC
motor power drive circuits simply switch on and off, and the motor
runs more slowly because it's only receiving power for 25%, 50%, or
some other fractional percentage of the time.

A servo motor is an entirely different story.  The servo motor is
actually an assembly of four things: a normal DC motor, a gear
reduction unit, a position-sensing device (usually a potentiometer --
a volume control knob), and a control circuit.  

The function of the servo is to receive a control signal that
represents a DESIRED OUTPUT POSITION OF THE SERVO SHAFT, and apply
power to its DC motor until its shaft turns to that position.  It uses
the position-sensing device to determine the rotational position of
the shaft, so it knows which way the motor must turn to move the shaft
to the commanded position.  The shaft typically does NOT rotate freely
round and round like a DC motor, but rather can only turn 200 degrees
or so back and forth.

The servo has a 3 wire connection: power, ground, and control.  The
power source must be constantly applied; the servo has its own drive
electronics that draw current from the power lead to drive the motor.

The control signal is pulse width modulated (PWM), but here the
DURATION of the positive-going pulse determines the POSITION of the
servo shaft.  For instance, a 1.520 millisecond pulse is the center
position for a Futaba S148 servo.  A longer pulse make the servo turn
to a clockwise-from-center position, and a shorter pulse make the
servo turn to a counter-clockwise-from-center position.  

The servo control pulse is repeated every 20 milliseconds.  In
essence, every 20 milliseconds you are telling the servo "go here."


To recap, there are two important differences between the control
pulse of the servo motor versus the DC motor.  First, on the servo
motor, duty cycle (on-time vs. off-time) has NO MEANING whatsoever --
all that matters is the absolute duration of the positive-going pulse,
which corresponds to a commanded output position of the servo shaft.
Second, the servo has its own power electronics, so VERY LITTLE POWER
flows over the control signal.  All power is draw from its power lead,
which must be simply hooked up to a high-current source of 5 volts.

Contrast this to the DC motor.  On the Handy Board, there are specific
motor driver circuits for four DC motors.  Remember, a DC motor is
like a light bulb; it has no electronics of its own and it requires a
large amount of drive current to be supplied to it.  This is the
function of the L293D chips on the Handy Board, to act as large
current switches for operating DC motors.

Plans and software drivers have been given to operate two servo motors
from the HB.  This is done simply by taking spare digital outputs,
which are used to generate the precise timing waveform that the servo
uses as a control input.  Very little current flows over these servo
control signals, because the servo has its own internal drive
electronics for running its built-in motors.


Typically, the term PWM (pulse-width modulation) refers to power
control on a DC motor, not the servo control waveform.  I can see why
it makes sense to call the servo control signal a pulse-width
modulated signal (since the width of the pulses confers a positional
meaning!), but it is not the traditional usage of the term.

i have been looking thru the libraries that people have posted on the web,
particularly the ones that allow serial communication.  i am not sure how the
system works, but there are numerous routines which turn handshake on and off,
as well as routines which will time out if there is no response from the
receiving device.  i am not sure what handshake is, i am guessing that it is a
"ready check".  i am wondering how the protocol for sending data is set up,
and if there is a way to access the bare bones I/O that the HC11 comes with.
is the difference extra software procedures that the HB uses to insure proper
data transmission?  is there any way that one can program the HB to use simple
start/stopbit protocol to receive data.  in particular, i am interested in
interfacing the HB with a GPS receiver, which i know are designed to
communicate with a microcontroller.  what type of transfer protocol is used in
this application?  if anyone has info on libraries that allow this kind of
communication, please let me know.  or would this have to be done thru
assembly language?  thanks for your help.

Justin,

Interfacing a GPS to the handyboard is straight forward.  Most GPS receivers
comply with the National Marine Electronics Association (NMEA) standards.  They
transmit their information in ASCII  "sentences" which are framed by a $ at the
beginning and <cr><lf> at the end. The data elements, such as lat, lon, elevation,
speed and direction are comma delimited and their position in the sentence is
determined by the NMEA standard.  It is simply a matter of counting commas to
identify any of the elements. Error checking is limited to a calculated checksum
which is transmitted at the end of the sentence.  It should be easy to recalculate
this value (it is the XOR of all the data elements), and compare with the
transmitted value.

I have my Tripmate GPS unit connected, and I pull out current position. I  use a
V2X compass connected to SPI for heading info.   Several good  sites related to
GPS and the NMEA standards are available. Here is a link to one you might try.

If interested, I can send you the IC program I use.

Could someone please help me get my handyboard to communicate with the =
computer??
First, my computer crashed, the hard disk had to be formatted,windows 95 =

thru com 4.
When I plug the handyboard to what was formerly com 4 the green light is =
lit like everything is ok but when I try to download to the board I get =
the message that the com port is not avalable or may be in use by =
another program.
I had the com port installed by a computer store probably a year ago and =
don't remember having any disk to go along with it.
It's like the computer cannot recognize the port.
I went to  the <control panel> <install new hardware > the search turned =
up no new hardware .
 Any one know how I can get my old com port back???????
com 1 is the mouse
com 2 is the modem

                                                                    =

Hello,
	I've been trying to compile  .asm files using as11.exe.  The files I
received with my copy of IC contain the #include directive.  Does anyone
know of a copy of as11.exe that supports this?  If I use as11_ic.bat, to
build an *.icb file, the gcc compiler says that it can't find the include
files, even when I specify the full path.  Why is this?
	Secondly, I am trying to get HexMon to run on my HandyBoard.  It seems to
download correctly,  but is there a quick way to test that it is running
correctly.  Ultimately I want to get the MB_Test program to interface with
it, but it just hangs for now.

Thanks,
	Aaron Edsinger

I too have done this, with both a Garmin GPS-II+ and a Garmin GPS-35PC.  I
have posted segments of the code necessary to do this to the Handyboard
list before, so if you look through the archives and grep for "WE7U", you
should find them.  If you can't, let me know and I can look for my copy of
the message.

John:  I would be interested in seeing your code, for the reason that I
have written a nice Perl program that will display GPS data in real-time,
and was trying at one time to get support working for a Tripmate as well.
The Tripmate that I borrowed had to go back to the owner too quick before
I had it all working.  I works very nicely with any Garmin GPS that I've
tried it with, but of course the Tripmate needs a special sentence sent to
it, and the handshaking has to be right (I needed to wire a special
adapter to pass DTR through, and didn't get around to doing that).

Subject: Re: any micromice out there?

Hi Brian,

    Several of my Penn State Abington freshman and sophomore engineering
students constructed a working micromouse from LEGO and a HB. The approach
was a vehicle that can only move in the north-south or east-west directions
by alternately lowering and raising sets of powered wheels using a servo
motor. (The same approach was used in a successful fire-fighting robot.)
The robot uses 2, 9-volt LEGO motors, IR sensors from Radio Shack for
wall-sensing, and is programmed in IC ( 500+ LOC).

     The micromouse earned second place in a MM contest sponsored by the
Phila. IEEE section held at Drexel University this past March '98. Only 3
teams participated, but we were the only team with a home-built MM, the
other schools in the area purchased "Mappy" robots from Japan which need be
programmed in assembly language. =20

    The first version of the LEGO/HB robot for the 1997 MM contest was
designed, constructed, and programmed in less than 2 weeks (including 1 week
of Spring break) -- that's dedication.  Unfortunately, a program bug
surfaced during the '97 contest.  Our robot is currently slow, but it was
successful in solving the maze, and we hope to make some s/w changes to
speed up execution time and improve the search technique.

   Due to the small size of a MM, the students found it very challenging to
build a frame from LEGO -- but it certainly can be done. We did not have the
time to explore many alternate approaches.  The students maxed out the
memory space on the HB at one point, but there is much room for improvements
in efficiency -- the HB met the challenge.  Some of our "out of memory"
problems seemed to disappear with IC3.2.  Software for a MM can be quite
complex.

  When I get a chance I will post pictures and s/w of the MM robot, along
with robots from our other contests.

Good luck.

Regarding your earlier message, if you're just wanting to talk to a GPS,
then you don't need handshaking, because I haven't found one yet that
supports it.  It is a simple three-wire interface to most GPS's, TX/RX and
Ground.  They don't support software-handshaking in/out of GPS's, and the
hardware handshaking lines just aren't present, so that's out too.  If you
miss sentences because of any reason at all, tough luck.

What I ended up having to do with my IC programs was optimize them as much
as possible so that I didn't lose many characters.  They way I chose to do
that (right or wrong) was to go snag a large buffer worth of characters
all at once, and then run off and process that buffer's worth.  I also
couldn't really do much in the way of floating point or anything else that
took up a lot of time.  I think my update rate ended up being about once
in four seconds, which means I was losing about half of the sentences at
4800 baud.  The key point though is that I didn't lose ANY characters when
I was just concentrating on filling the buffer.

I would then look in the buffer for a particular start sequence (I chose
the RMC sentence), and then process until I found another RMC sentence, at
which point I would throw the rest of the buffer away and go collect
another buffer's worth.

Strange, but it worked.

My next goal is to change over to using GCC as the compiler, so I can get
much more speed out of the Handyboard and do a lot more processing of the
data.

All pcodes shipped with IC 3.1/3.2 are designed to work fine either with
or without LCD.

Prior to 3.1, you have to build a pcode specially to disable the LCD.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hello,

I am hooking some HP decoder chips to the handyboard.  They are
HCTL-2020's and they decode a motor position encoder signal.  My problem
is that I need to hook one of the pins on the 2020 (the CLK pin) to a
clock.  I'd like to get ahold of the E pin on the microprossesor but I
don't know where I can get that output on the handyboard.  My only other
option is to build my own clock.

Help appreciated.
Thanks,
Chad

Here is the file.  Please feel free to modify/improve.  I'm a doctor not a
programmer, and I better keep my day job.

Notice it borrows Randy Sargent's and Dr. Richard F. Drushel's routines found in
serialio.c and math.c, both on the handy board web site.

This program could be used with any NEMA compliant GPS receiver.  The Tripmate
has two quirks: First, the DTR line is taken high to turn on the receiver.
Second, after power up, the receiver sends an ASCII string 'ASTRAL' and waits for
the computer to respond with the same string.  I handled this by connecting two
DB9 plugs together, shorting pins 2 and 3 (the Rx and Tx pins) on the GPS side
and then connecting these to pin 3 on the handyboard end. This causes the
'Astral' string transmitted by the GPS unit to echo back and trick the GPS.  Also
connect pin 4 (DTR) to a lead and plug into any +5 v location on the handy board.
Then connect the jumpered plug to the handy board serial adapter (GPS outputs at
RS-232 signal levels, need to change to TTL.)  Now when the handy board is turned
on, the GPS unit is powered up and begins to acquire satalites. Sit back and wait
untill you have a valid signal, and you're in business. I've made this sound
hard, but it takes 15 minutes and a little solder.

I started to write a routine for calculating the checksum and compare with
transmitted, but never finished. What I have is at the end of the file. Possibly
someone would like to finish it.  I would appreciate any improvements. Thanks

John

I had same problem, and found that if you put the include files in the same directory
as your file to be complied, and then place the file in quotes (eg. #include
"6811regs.asm") it will compile.

I know someone just asked this question, but where can I buy just the lego
motors, and not the $45.00 set from a toy store.


Thanks,

the motor is available via LEGO Shop at Home (S@H for short)
tel: 1-800-453-4652

there are three kind of motors:
#5114    $17.50 (the one that you see in #8270, old style)
#5225    $17.50 (the one that in #8735, newer one, with gear reduction)
#5119    $11.00 (micro motor, the one in set #8480 to open the satellite
wings)

the other source for LEGO motor is PITSCOm they carry the LEGO DACTA
products
tel: 1-800-362-4308

the part number:
#775114    $24.50 (#5114)
#775225    $24.50 (#5225)
#775119    $23.00 (#5119)

here is a scan of the parts from PITSCO
http://www.ee.nmt.edu/~jmathis/dacta.html
(this is NOT my webpage)

so, it is cheaper to buy it from LEGO S@H, and you don't have to pay
shipping if buying from S@H
but, PITSCO carry some very neat parts which are not available from S@H,
such as the large turntable (the one you see in set #8460, #8459, btw, the
part# is 779876, 2 for $9.50 + shipping) and converyor belt links.
PITSCO also have some sensors, such as light sensors, touch sensors,
temperature sensors and angle sensors. I was wondering, does anybody ever
use the angle sensors? it seem to be a fun one to play with...
hope that helps
Sterling

Subject: Windows NT experiences?

Hi all, I was wondering if people would please "share" their experiences
running Interactive C on Windows NT.  Is anyone using the old freeware
DOS IC on NT?  Did you have any trouble getting it to work?

Please send to the list, or me privately if you'd rather not.  

Thanks,
Fred

I've been using IC3.2 on Windows NT/4.0 with very few problems.  I used
to have IC lock up occasionally, but only when I disconnected the Handy
Board at weird times.  Once I was more careful about disconnecting the
Handy Board only when IC was at a command prompt (not running a routine)
I didn't have any more troubles.

I use IC 2.8 under NT with no problems. Before you can use IC under NT,
you`ll have to turn off the COM-port your HB is connected to under NT, or
else NT won't let IC use it. You can delete the COM port in the `ports`
part in you configuration screen.
I can even use the DOS p-code downloader. Actually, I have to, since the
Windows-based downlaoder which is around, can`t use the right COM-port,
since it was deleted.
So as long as you only use DOS programs, everything works just fine.

Hi everyone,
	First, sorry for the blank message just now -- hit the send
button instead of the cancel.

	I'm working on a project where I've got robots hunting targets
equipped with a 40 kHz oscillator circuit which is continuously pulsing
an IR LED. I was using the Sharp GP1U52 IR demodulator, which is the one
that you can get from Radio Shack (the alumimum box version).  We were
able to get a very strong signal from this component.  However, when we
switched to the IS1U60 IR demodulator (the one that you get with the
Handyboard from Gleason--the little green one), we found that we could
only get a signal when we first turned on the 40 kHz transmitter.  If the
transmitter continuously bathed the IS1U60 in 40 kHz light, the receiver
returned nothing.  If we switched the transmitter on and off, we got a
single pulse from the receiver whenever power was applied.

	So... it seems that the IS1U60 is designed to receive IR pulses
in a communications mode like from a VCR remote or another handyboard.
It does not seem to respond to continuous transmission.  Has anybody else
had this problem?  It's a whole lot easier to obtain the IS1U60s instead
of the GP1U52s (Radio Shacks only stock 2 or 3 at a time!) and it seems
that the GP1U52 is the only way to go.

Help!

Thanks...

-Paul

I had a similar experience, except that all my IR demodulators were
from Radio Shack; two were some I'd gotten in a "grab bag" quite a few
years ago, and the others were brand new.  The original one reacted to
40KHz the way you describe yours doing - whenever it "sees" 40KHz, the
output goes active.  On the new ones that I had, though, the behavior
was more like what you describe for the ISU160; they go active when
they first see 40KHz, but then they quickly go inactive again, until
you pulse the 40KHz.  I ended up modulating the transmitter at 200Hz
and putting a 567 tone-decoder set up to look for 200Hz on the output.
Perhaps you could do something similar?  The 40KHz is just a carrier,
and is modulated by the 200Hz signal.  The IR demodulator strips out
the 40KHz, leaving just the original 200Hz modulation at its output.
At least one person tried to convice me I was crazy, but I swear that
Radio Shack's detectors have changed over the years, even though they
sell them under the same RS part number.  The case style, as well as
the markings of the devices themselves, have changed slightly; I have
ot believe the characteristics have as well...

the problem that i was having with the onboard IR receiver is that the codes
that i retrieved from the ir_data() function were inconsistant from the same
remote control button.  the error was usually manifested in multiples of two,
which lead me to believe that the data coming in has been logically
(arithmetically) shifted.  this was probably due to the first and sometimes
second incoming bit being missed.  however, i developed a way to eliminate
this problem about 99% of the time.  this is by turning the software driver on
and off, by using the sony_init() function.  in my tests, the receiver
responds much better than before, however, it does not poll continuosly.  i
thought that maybe the HB could be tricked into polling continuosly, maybe
this will lead you in the right direction.

"Hi",  from Hector Noriega, I am trying to send a data byte from port C o=

assembly code but I can =

not enable the address decoder using port B for the msb and port C for th=

lsb and the data.
The command that works  in "IC" is poke(6fff, data).
 Could someone give me a hint with the assembly code?

Never mind, I have managed to solve the problem by cutting the trace =
between the 47k pull-up resistor and the sensor input.

Hmmmmmm.. as I recall, there are 47k pullups on those inputs.  These are
used to condition the signals when used as a digital input.  The 'HC11
pink book suggests that any input resistance of greater then 10K will
"...degrade A/D accuracy."  The ADC module draws 400nA continuously.  Your
220K will drop ~80 mV.  This will result in only 6(ish) bit precision.
Also, the ADC subsystem is modeled as 20pF cap.  220K driving such a cap
will increase your acquisition time significatly.   You will definately
want to condition this signal with a low impedance driver.  I suggest an
instrumentation amplifier (a special kind of rail to rail, high frequency
Op-Amp) to condition that signal.  National Semiconductor offers many
single supply, rail to rail devices. Analog Devices has a pretty keen
selection too.  I don't remember the particular part number, but NS has a
swift selection tree.  The output impedance of an OpAmp is quite low.
This means you will be able to leave the 47K's on the HB ADC inputs alone.

I have a sonar mounted on a panning servo, and I just bought an
el-cheapo Cirrus CS-50.  (It is functionally equivalent to a JR/Hitec
JR-507 or HS-300).  It works fine, although it is a noisy little bugger
(but other servos don't seem much better).  It has enough torque to
move a transducer around, and has a decent transit time
(42.3 oz-in and 0.16s/60 deg at 4.8v).  I say go for it.

Cheers, Skye.

Where is your source and how do the Cirrus compare to Futuba in price?

At a local hobby store in Houston I bought 2 Futuba 3003 (I think) that are
the replacements for the 148 which I believe are no longer being made. They
cost me about $13 but list was about $20. The Hitec models were a couple of
dollars more expensive. The Cirrus seems to be faster since the Futuba was .23
sec for 60 degrees at 4.8V.

Subject: Multi-tasking under IC (Freeware version)

I am somewhat new to handyboards and IC, so bear with me if this issue has
been dealt with before.  (I did check the FAQ and "some" of this list's
archives prior to posting.)

Under IC (the freeware version) cooperating processes communicate using
shared global memory.  What is the standard method (under IC) for
preventing race conditions?

One could "hog" the processor prior to entering a critical section and then
release the processor when concluded; but this seems inelegant.

Feel free to email me directly or post to the list.

Thanks in advance for any assistance,

Hi there,
I have used a 68HC11E1 with my HB for quite a while now and it works
fine with it. Now I replaced it with a 68HC11A1FN and it wouldn't let me
download the .s19 file with HBDL anymore. It stops when downloading the
program and says: Invalid Config reg (0x0D) Try again.
I did. I tried again. And failed. Then I wrote 0x0D instead 0x0C into
set config register and everything works fine now. IC runs fine and
everything (inputs etc.) appears to be working. 
My questions: 
Is it OK to run the board with 0x0D instead of 0x0C?
What exactly does this config register do? Does my HB work differntly
with the new setting?

Dear all,

The design for the Handy Board Expansion Board is done, and I am now
sponsoring a limited beta-test program.

I know that many of you have been waiting a long time for the board,
and I will be asking most of you to wait a little longer as the beta
test is performed, but I think you will be happy with the results.

The most-requested features, including nine digital outputs and six
servo motor outputs, have been incorporated into the new design.

For more information on the design, see

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/hbexp30b/

If you would like to participate in the beta-test program, see

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/hbexp30b/betatest.html

I am anticipating the final design will be available at the end of the
summer.

Yours,
Fred

Hello again,
	      I hope someone can help me out here.  I want to run a standard
assembly program on my HandyBoard without using IC.  IC requires
CONFIG=0x0C, which allows the reset vector to be fetched from external
memory, instead of from $FFFE, $FFFF.  Where does it find its reset vector
then?  How can I set it to find my program?  It seems that  MAIN_START is
found at $8020, but I am assuming this particular to using IC.  

Thanks,
	Aaron

When pcode is downloaded to the Handy Board, how much memory space does i=
t take up?

I am a little concerned about having enough memory space for my programs.=
 As I see it now, I think I may max out the 32KB.=20

Does anyone have tips on how to concerve space. The only thing I can thin=
k of is to edit out some functions from lib_hb.c that I am not using, and=
 also not loading the r22 IR files which I'm not using either.

(I think someone posted once about a similar problem and said that some s=
pace concerving was solved after using the commericial version of IC, how=
 so?)

Is it possible to expand the memory, or is 32 KB the most I can work with=
?

Thanks in advance,

I have a problem with the tone functions.  I tried each of the following:

1000 - 9000 Hz tones for 2 to 3 seconds.  All work fine up to 5000 but 6000 and 
above have broken up sound.  Can anyone explain why this happens?  What is 
the fix?

independent of IC, the HB fetches its reset vector at $bffe-$bfff. 

please see the FAQ about this:

yep, 5 kHz is about the top end of the HB's 6811 capability.  going
higher would require dedicating the 'hc11 to generating the tone and
doing nothing else.

why?  interrupt routine overhead.  takes a bunch of cycles to handle
an interrupt.  the tone function uses the interrupt so it normally
doesn't have to hog the CPU.  

if you hog the CPU, you can go up to 100khz or so...

Hi!
If you start the Handyboard (no bootstrap mode) it is in the 'special
test' mode. So the start vector is located at $BFFE and $BFFF. In
your assambly program use the following code:

Start_vec	ORG $BFFE
		FDB Program_Start

where 'Program_Start'  is the label of the first line of your
main program. Compile the code and download it with the normal 
bootstrap-loader. Switch off and on and your program should start.

Hope it help you.

sincerely
     tom

The 0x0C value represents EEPROM OFF, ROM OFF.

A related question that I have is that I'm using the 811E2 and the hbdl program 
will only work if I use 0xFF.  Which places EEPROM ON and at the upper 
most locations.

Also, IC seems to work fine.  What will NOT work?  And what is the likelyhood 
that IC will stop working?

Does anyone know of a workaround that will allow me to use IC and be able to 
turn off the 811E2 EEPROM?   HBDL will only work with the 811E2 if I use FF 
as the configuration register value.

I have been having problems finding the A1FN for some reason.  I have tried all 
the likely sources and everyone seems to be back ordered.  I however have 
many of the 811E2s and a couple of other EEPROM varities.

what is the r22 ir code for?  I also understand that if I use the sony-ir that 
I should not use the r22 but I'd like to know what it is for anyway.

Casio used to make/maybe still makes a wristwatch-TV remote controller
that did Sony.  I have one and it works great.

sorry don't have it handy to give you the model #....

I just found out about a Canadian supplier of hobby robotics in Canada.

http://www.hvwtech.com

They have robot kits, some good looking gearboxes (for those who have
wrestled with making their own), L293 and L298 motor driver kits and 
other robotics goodies.  

This is of special interest for Canadians, of course (save duty etc.) 
but may be a useful resource to our friends overseas and south of the 
border.

Cheers, Skye.

(Fear not, I am in *no* way related to this operation!)

Subject: Cheap air flow sensor
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Does anyone know of a cheap way to construct an air flow sensor? I was
looking for an article in EDN  on using a self-heated transistor to measure
airflow, but  Ican't find it.

I was also wanting to know if there is a way to create a humidity sensor,
or does anyone know of a low cost part?

I am wanting to connect these to a miniboard.

Thanks

We have used model boat propellers on a ballbearing and on a brass bushing.
Keep the bearing or bushing well lubricated for good sensitivity at low
air volume (ie: low speed of the propeller).

We used the propeller mounted in 1.5 inch and 2 inch PVC black plumbing pipe.
Optical encoder replaced an optical diode pair which the three blade 
propeller tips moved through.

Universal Electronics (http://www.ueic.com/~ueic/) has a wide range
of universal Remote Control Units (that can be programmed to emulate
other Remote Control Units).  Check out
http://207.126.118.58/~ueic/eu/ofazapperline.html for several small
ones.

    code rather. This would be the generating the
    "p code" of the handy board rather than the actual
    IC code.

Regards,
-Pandit

Elektor had published a similar circuit for detecting air leaks.  The
heated transistor and another transistor acting as temp. sensor were
glued together using heatsink compound.  You had then to
nullify/calibrate a meter at ambient temp.  when the transistor pair was
held near a air leak, the temp. difference caused a meter deflection
(basically the current required to maintain the transistor temp. was
monitored).  The circuit was not meant for absolute air flow measurement
but could probably be modified.

I have this schematic somewhere at home.  May take a couple of days to
draw it in ASCII (I am not good at it :-).  Let me know if you are
interested.

Newark electronics used to carry a capacitive humidity sensor for about
$ 12.  The same device is manufactured by 2-3 companies.  I know Philips
and Volvo as two of these.

Subject: RE: Cheap air flow sensor

The classic small air flow sensor is a hot-wire-anemometer.  Just position a
short piece of very fine wire in the airflow and normal to it, run a
constant current thru it, and measure the voltage change due to the cooling
effect of the airflow.  Works great.  Unfortunately, the sensing wire is
ordinarily platinum (!) due to it's desireable resistivity/temperature
characteristics and relative inertness, however, cheaper wire may work.  It
must be VERY fine wire, however.

The classic, and cheap, humidity sensor is human hair, but measureing it's
change in length (which is the variable) may be a problem.  Alternately, you
can make one by making a pair of parallel traces on a bit of PC board, about
1mm wide and 0.5mm apart, and a few cm long.  Fold these back upon
themselves serpentine style to keep it small; the ones I've seen are about
1cm square.  Now all you have to do is measure the capacitance change... I
can't find these in any of my present catalogs, but I know I've seen them.
fischertechnik used to supply them, which is where I got mine.

I have a couple of nice motors that I would like to get some info on.  They were
removed from some medical recording devices.  They are very small and have
pretty good power.  If you try to stop the motor by grabbing the bushing on the 
shaft, it is very difficult.

Anyway, they don't have a brand but have the following markings.

escap (R) E16
64,1:1

swiss made
TC 11 205 0

They are about 1.9" long and .65" in diameter.  Anyone know how I can get 
some spec. on these?

I did a search for escap on the internet and nothing came back.  Thanks

BTW, it took me longer to realize that Motor was spelled wrong than it did for 
you to respond with the info I needed.

Thanks again.

 Interesting. But wouldn't the air temperature change the readings? Or
would you also use a temp. sensor and adjust your table scaling to take
this into account? What about air pressure, same thing?

Yup.  And yup again.  Not to mention humidity.  It's what makes
instrumentation "interesting".

Hi all,

I sent this message out a few days ago and havent heard from anyone. Can =
someone help me out?
----------

When pcode is downloaded to the Handy Board, how much memory space does i=
t take up?

I am a little concerned about having enough memory space for my programs.=
 As I see it now, I think I may max out the 32KB.=20

Does anyone have tips on how to concerve space. The only thing I can thin=
k of is to edit out some functions from lib_hb.c that I am not using, and=
 also not loading the r22 IR files which I'm not using either.

(I think someone posted once about a similar problem and said that some s=
pace concerving was solved after using the commericial version of IC, how=
 so?)

Thanks in advance,

This is what Fred Martin wrote in a earlier message to this mail list.

This is the approximate breakdown of the HB memory space.

User program object code + user global variables: 16320 bytes available
Runtime pcode OS: 7936 bytes
Used stack space for user processes: 6656 bytes
Used buffer for interaction process: 256 bytes
Used buffer for printing: 256 bytes used


Editing out any unused functions/procedures in the library will save some
space but not much.

 Do you happen to know if those changes are linear? Something like this
would make a cool replacement for the MAS on the Talon. It uses a series of
honeycombs (that form little diamond shapes). Then it measures the number
of spinning vortices coming off the honeycomb (via ultrasound) -it's called
the Karmen-???? phenomenon. It's also a pretty restrictive piece of the
intake path. 

  A cylinder with one of these platinum wires crossing it (along w/the
extra sensors needed) with a PIC as the glue would really be slick, as long
as the mapping (or math) to do something useful with it wasn't to hairy.

Brian,
The RAM memory space is divided into two big parts very roughly like this:
   0x8000 - about 0xBE00 or so   = your "user" program
                                   (the C program sent by I-C)
   0xBFxx - 0xBFFF               = interrupt vector table (immovable!)
   0xC000 - 0xFEFF               = PCODE.S19 pcode engine & its work areas
   0xFFF0 - 0xFFFF               = CPU stack space

You will always have a bit under 16 kB (0x8000 - 0xBF??) for your user
programs, that is:
- your own C files
- the Library C files
- any ICB assembler files you use.
When IC sends your files to the Handyboard, it displays the memory location
of the various component files of your project.  You can guage how full you
are: the closer you get to 0xBE00 or so (on the I-C display), the fuller
you are getting!

You have to save space in the 8000-bf00 area.  Curtailing library functions
is wise.  

But using a different version of I-C, along with its fresh compilation of
the PCODE interpreter engine, could conceivably affect the use of memory in
the upper region (c000-FF00) very slightly, but that is of no use to you in
squeezing in more of your own project files (8000-bf00).

The facts are, that the HB just has a certain memory allowance for your
programs, and you have to be as efficient within that space as you can!

Brian Lavery  <blavery@computer.org>

Could someone tell me how to use the
hog_processor(). I want to dedicate the
controller to only one task. I tried the following
program but it did not go faster than 700HZ.
void main()
  {   =

   while(1)
    {      =

     hog_processor();
      v_opt =3D analog(0);   /*measure optical sensor */
      poke(0x6fff,v_opt);     /* A/D correction */
    }  /* end of while */
    }  /* end of main program*/

Thank you in advance.

Hi all,
I'm new on this board, and just ordered my handyboard.
As for hardware , i still have lots of bend-sensors (strain-gages) recovered
from old PowerGlove's. If anyone needs these sensors, please email me,
I will use them myself on the project i'm working now with the handyboard.

They keep falling down:-)

Sorry, couldn't resist that.  Check out the MIT site.  They have a good robotics 
department.  I don't know if it was MIT or not but I say a robot that was 
developed at one of these institutions that was one-legged and could do flips 
and still maintain balance.

Maybe someone knows the link to that one.

I've recently bought a Stampbug (6 legged walker) from Milford
Instruments
( http://www.milinst.demon.co.uk/ ) in the UK and they have a simple 2
legged robot in their catalog. 

I hope this is of help.

Subject: Handy Board Header
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII


I'm trying to order the handy board headers (J3-4, J6-8, etc).  I've got a
digi-key part number of
ED72xx-ND  where xx is the number of pins for the female.  Is this correct?

There seems to be a wide varity on the male J15, does someone have a part
number or dimensions?

The photo of J6 the 4x2 header looks like 2 rows of singles, is this right?

Thanks

Related Question.  

I am working on a robot project with my daughter this summer.  I was 
wondering how many walking robot kits there out there.  I would like a high 
quality one that lends itself to further development.

Also, I have seen most of the robot chassis kits, I believe but have not seen too 
many track models.  Like the paragraph above I am looking for a relatively high 
quality (small, sturdy, reliable, repairable) one.

Anybody know of any?  Tracked preferred but wheeled is ok too.

An option is to build one but I have no clue where to get parts like tracks (belts) 
and gearing to match, gears, etc.  I have tried RC Hobbie shops but they are 
very limited.

make sure you get FEMALE header for the HB itself.   The only male
header is for the LCD, to plug it into its female socket on the HB.

It looks like the ED72xx parts are MALE.  You probably want ED71xx for
female.  Please note I haven't ordered ED7xxx components before, so
I'm not absolutely sure they're right, but they look right from the
cat page.

I'll have to check this out.  We havn't actually used hot-wire-anemometers
recently, partly because we havn't had the need, and partly because
vortex-shedding flowmeters are all the rage right now.  My memory is they
are not linear, but that the curve is second order and easy to handle.
Temperature, density, and heat content of the medium are a big problem, but
if these don't vary much...
They ARE small. And fragile.  I replaced one once by crushing a flashlight
bulb, recovering the filament mount and soldering the platinum wire in place
of the filament.  Under a microscope.  Don't sneeze.

Hmm..it sounds like it might be a lot more work to actually get something
like this to work reliably in a car where all of the above can vary by a
great amount.

Subject: System interupt problems?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I need some help! We have a handy board hooked up to some decoders,
which we will use to help track our robot as it moves across the floor.
We have to do a few pokes and a peek to read the decoders, but we've got
it all set up and it works beautifully if you do it manually.

  However, because the encoders have a very high resolution, we need to
constantly read the decoders so that their counters don't overflow and
wrap-around.  I figured that I'd write an assembly routine and have it
triggered by the system interrupt (TOC4) so that it is constantly
reading the decoders and keeping a total of how much they have changed.

  I successfully wrote an assembly routine that works just fine if it is
called from a C program.  To test it, I have a simple loop that runs the
motor forward and the backward (for a specified amount of time), calling
my assembly routine to update the value and the displaying the global
counter each time.

  However, if I take the EXACT same piece of code and link it in to the
TOC4 interrupt, it doesn't work correctly.  While before I read approx.
80 (forward) and -80 (reverse) for each turn of the motor, now it reads
approx. -6 (forward) and -1100 (reverse) for each turn.

  I'll attach the code I'm using below.  Does anyone have any ideas as
to what might be causing the problem?  Are there some other things going
on with the interrupt that I should be aware of?  I have tried slowing
it down a little (keeping a count and only reading the decoders once
every 200 TOC4 interrupts or so), but the results are identical.

  Any help would be appreciated -- this one's had me stumped all day and
I have't been making any progress with it.  Thanks!

Not to mention that the sensor that is already built-in to the car is
probably non-linear as well, which means that the software in the car's
computer is already set up for that specific curve.  If you were to
replace it with another technology, you'd want to approximate the curve of
the orginal sensor, not a linear function.

 Actually, I'd want to modify the curve. Stock, the cars run very rich. For
people interested in getting the most hp out of them, we'd want to be able
to lean the engine out a bit (along with reducing the intake restriction).
But this is getting away from the HB topic ;-)

Mike,
	I have actually seen only 3 reasonable quality walkers on the market
(the 6 legged kind) but I have to admit that I haven't searched that far
recently. Lynxmotion (http://www.lynxmotion.com) do one which looks to
be pretty good quality however it is a bit expensive, it also requires
12 servos. Novasoft (http://www.mil.ufl.edu/novasoft/) also do a 12
servo, 6 legged walker which is a different design from the Lynxmotion
one but still looks pretty good. The final one is the Stampbug, this is
a 3 servo, 6 legged walker from Parallax (http://www.parallaxinc.com/)
which is fairly restricted in it's development but is a simple starting
point (it is driven by either a pic or Basic stamp1 but the servos can
be controlled from any source as long as it isn't to heavy, the stampbug
is quite small).
Hope this helps.

John Hatton

Tim,

I just scanned your code, so I might have missed it, but don't you have to
clear (or set) a flag in your interrupt routine to reenable the TOC4
interrupt?

Mike

	Subject:  System interupt problems?

	I need some help! We have a handy board hooked up to some decoders,
	which we will use to help track our robot as it moves across the
floor.
	We have to do a few pokes and a peek to read the decoders, but we've
got
	it all set up and it works beautifully if you do it manually.

	  However, because the encoders have a very high resolution, we need
to
	constantly read the decoders so that their counters don't overflow
and
	wrap-around.  I figured that I'd write an assembly routine and have
it
	triggered by the system interrupt (TOC4) so that it is constantly
	reading the decoders and keeping a total of how much they have
changed.

	  I successfully wrote an assembly routine that works just fine if
it is
	called from a C program.  To test it, I have a simple loop that runs
the
	motor forward and the backward (for a specified amount of time),
calling
	my assembly routine to update the value and the displaying the
global
	counter each time.

	  However, if I take the EXACT same piece of code and link it in to
the
	TOC4 interrupt, it doesn't work correctly.  While before I read
approx.
	80 (forward) and -80 (reverse) for each turn of the motor, now it
reads
	approx. -6 (forward) and -1100 (reverse) for each turn.

	  I'll attach the code I'm using below.  Does anyone have any ideas
as
	to what might be causing the problem?  Are there some other things
going
	on with the interrupt that I should be aware of?  I have tried
slowing
	it down a little (keeping a count and only reading the decoders once
	every 200 TOC4 interrupts or so), but the results are identical.

	  Any help would be appreciated -- this one's had me stumped all day
and
	I have't been making any progress with it.  Thanks!

  I'm pretty sure that since the Handy Board also uses TOC4 as its system 
interrupt, that it takes care of clearing the interrupt.  My code just gets linked in 
and gets executed before the Handy Board code (though I don't know what the 
HB code does exactly).  Besides, it doesn't lock up the system -- it just gives 
incorrect (but consistent) results.  Also, in the small example code in the Handy 
Board manual, which uses this same interrupt to drive the beeper at 1000Hz, I 
don't remember them clearing or setting any interrupts either. Is my assumption 
wrong?
  I'm beginning to think that maybe its a problem with the decoder itself -- I may 
just be reading it too fast.  I'll try to slow it down various ways today (even 
though I've already tried that to some extent) to see if I can get around the 
problem.  I may also try using different interrupts and see what happens.

  Thanks for the help.

Subject: Freewawre IC Error
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

	I just got my hands on a beautiful old monster of an AT PC (Cost=$0).  I
figured, why not transfer IC over to that computer, and use it in my
workshop instead of programming the 'board on our main computer and then
bringing it down to the basement.  The PC downloaded fine using dl.exe, and
all that.  I reconfingured (Freeware) IC, and then when I ran it, I got
this error (after it synchronized with the board and right before it
finished loading lib_hb.c by default):
	run-time error M6107: MATH
	 ~floating-point error: unemulated

Does that mean I need a math coprocessor in order to load things into the
HB?  I tried not loading the libs by default, and I synchronized the board
and got all the way to the "C>" prompt.  From there, I can communicate with
the board and do math etc.  Please tell me fixes, bad news, etc.

you are correct, you are just attaching yourself to the beginning of the
interrupt service routine, and the job of formatting system flags is taken
care of by the ISR.
however, i do see something that may be causing numerical errors.  in the
code, you only concern yourself with the lower byte of the D accumulator, so
you take the contents of the B accumulator, and copy it to the A accumulator
also, which is fine, but then you go ahead to store the whole D accumulator
into "TCOUNT", which is storing the value of the A accumulator along with
value of the B accumulator.  i am not sure if this is causing problems, but i
know that small things like this can cause huge problems.  instead of "STD
variable_TCOUNT", try "STAB variable_TCOUNT".  this may help.

Since I know how this one behaves, I can use that info as a comparrison.

What Futuba mode is closest to this one? (11 oz-in at 4.8v)

Does anyone have experience modifying IC for use with the BotBoard 2? (i.e.,
changing address for the beeper, etc.) I have been able to get IC to download
and run, but I would like to customize it to fit the hardward on the BB2.

On a related note, are there docs for the library functions and built in

        Other than using Lego or fischertechnik tracks (about equal in

http://www.hobbyweb.com/

        Browse under Tamiya, Armor/AFV, 1/16 scale.  The 3 older models:
#56004 "King Tiger"; #56003 "Flakpanzer Gepard"; and #56002 "Leopard A4" are
suitable for radio control.  Although the bodies of these models are
plastic, they have a stiff metal chassis, good (metal&plastic) running gear
& tracks  gearboxes and may even still come with the gearmotors.

        Now the bad news.  Have $500 ready.

 The Tonka toy dozer has some pretty tough tracks on it, but you 
would have to make the wheels. The ones on the toy are made of 
plastic too thin to attach a drive mechanism to. There may be a 
better solution, however. There are two options I think might work:

1. Conveyor belt manufacturers are increasingly going towards making 
them out of small 'track like' sections. Each section is made out of 
plastic and attaches in the center to the drive mechanism, usually a 
chain drive. The sections also connect together. Some of the narrower 
ones (for small conveyor belts) might work nicely. One disadvantage 
is that the sections are extremely smooth (on top) and would need 
some type of tread glued on (the bottom in our application). Again, 
you would have to make the wheels. The conveyor parts would have to 
be for a linear conveyor, the sections designed for curving are (you 
guessed it)... curved, and wouldn't work for a robot track.

2. Recently I've seen a type of plastic cable guide system that uses 
linked sections that are hollow on the inside. The stuff I've seen 
snaps together and only bends one way. It's used on large repetitive 
motion machines, like CNC machining centers where driver wires don't 
move very far but do move back and forth alot. I'm not describing 
this product well, but it's basically an articulating 'box' that 
houses the wires. This stuff is made of tough, thick plastic that 
would hold up well. Again, you would have to come up with a wheel 
design...

   Hope this helps, Duncan

Subject: servo w/ 360 rotation? Hi torque?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Are there any servos available with 360 or near 360 rotation?  I'd like
one with more than 42 oz-in of torque, too.  Something closer to 150
oz-in would be nice.

Thanks,

Most Hobby shops can order replacment parts for these kits. (eg. the treads and
gears). The usually have catalogs that break out the different parts kits.

I just noticed the conversation about tracked robots.

We have done some work with them here at the U of M.  We have one of the
Tamiya tanks.  It is very nice, but only has one motor.  If you want to
do skid steering with both tracks at once, it will require modification.
Currently it steers by only turning on one side at a time.  It does move
very fast, and can carry a lot of weight.  Plus it is a very
well-engineered vehicle.

If you want to use the lego parts and want to have a tread-like vehicle,
the best solution we have found is to use two sets of chains per side. 
The robots very rarely throw a chain, unlike the treads which seem to
come apart very often. 

Another good solution is to use some kind of a toy treaded vehicle.  I
built a robot using the chassis from a wired remote control caterpillar.
It has two independant motors and gearboxes.  I did have to build my own
h-bridge for it, though, since the motors draw more current than the
handyboard h-bridge can handle.  While the one I used isn't available
anymore, radio shack sells remote controlled treaded vehicles from time
to time.  The motors on the radio shack toys can be driven right from the
handyboard h-bridge.  These solutions have the advantage of being
considerable cheaper than the Tamiya offerings.

Finally I managed to put the schematic of Wind-O-meter described in the
Elektor publication in ASCII.  Pl. set your reader font to something
like courier to view it properly.  I have taken some liberty with the
opamp symbol to accomodate some component connections.

M is a 50 mA meter (collector of T1).  Opamp supply connections not
shown.
T1 and T2 are maintained in good thermal contact by glueing them
together using a heat conductive adhesive.  This pair is used as the
probe to check wind speed/air leaks.  T2 is maintained at a constant
temperature by the opamp and T1.  When wind/leak is present, the pair is
cooled - more current has to flow through T1 to maintain the temp.  This
current is indicated by the meter. T3 acts as a reference diode.

The description says - A high sensitivity is obtained by making the
temp. of T2 about 5 degrees higher than its surroundings. This is
achieved by presetting the meter to give an offset of about 5 mA when
there is no wind blowing. BC 639 can be replaced by a BC 547 type. R1 is
selected so that the current through T1 is not excessive. Hope this
helps.

(circuit and description deleted)

Neat idea! It reminds me of a simple variometer (rate of climb/sink) 
circuit in an old RC glider magazine. It used two small naked bead or 
glass encapsulated thermistors  in a bridge circuit and the 
thermistors were in a tube connected to a bottle. As the air pressure 
changed and air flowed in or out,  the "up wind" one  cooled more 
than the "down wind" one in its wind shadow and any "common 
mode" temperature changes cancelled. Again the current was set to 
give the appropriate self heating. Very similar to what you describe.

        Regards,
            Graeme

Electronic Design "Ideas for Design" section had a interesting circuit for
a Low-Power Thermal Airspeed Sensor in the May 25, 1998 issue.

It's more complicated than the Elektor design but the ariticle helps
explain thermal anemometry with the King's Law equation.

Please help!!

I can't get the pcode_hb.s19 file into the handyboard to save my life.
Upon looking through the archives, I've noticed some traffic that looks
like it directly relates to my problem.  However, I couldn't find a
definitive solution.  

So if anyone who has had this problem could please tell me how they
were able to solve it, I would be forever in debt.  I'm under the gun.

Here is the synopsis:

1.  P5-133MHz laptop machine with windows 95
2.  verified functionality of serial port
3.  tried hbdl.exe and get either a "wrong port of board mode"
4.  tried dlm pcode_hb.s19 -256 in full-screen and get the following:
-----------------------------------------------------------
DLM:  6811 File Downloader with Intelligent EEPROM burn by Fred Martin
portions (C) 1992 by Randy Sargent
Version 2.4 Jun  8 1995 05:47:06

Downloading pcode_hb.s19, press ESC to abort
Downloading eeprom loader to RAM at 1200 baud...
................................
................................

................................
................................
................................

.............___________________
256 total bytes (boot loader done)

Synchronizing with board...OK
Sending pcode_hb.s19 at 9600 baud
Board memory error:  wanted 00, got 3e at address 8000
Board synchronization error. 
-----------------------------------------------------------

(and sometimes it gets much further into the download of the 
pcode_hb.s19, but the result is the same).

5.  the board does the following:

	a.  powers into bootstrap mode ok
	b.  power light flashes during bootload at 1200 baud
	c.  power light stays on continuously upon failure.

6.  i'm quite sure its not "bad" hardware because i have 2 complete 
    systems (handyboards, i/f boards, and all cables).

The microphone circuit on page 118 of Mobile Robots is confusing me...

Is that really a _1000uF_ cap?

What kind of cap is the 10uF?  No polarity is shown....

it sounds like it's *almost* working.

1.  did you try DL, not DLM, in full screen dos mode?

2.  try both of these as a DOS program.

3.  did you try adjusting your serial port parameters in the windows
control panel, a la the FAQ?

Thanks,

Thanks to your suggestions, I was finally able to get the bootloader
downloaded to my 2 handyboards.  What I ended up having to do was use
the DL.EXE program in full-screen mode.
I've had no trouble using the Windows95 version of IC (v3.1) to get my
code into the board since.

The thing that bothers me is I have no idea why I had to use DL in
full-screen to make the download work.  Even using this approach, one of
my boards was still very "squirrelly" and I had to play around with it
to make it happen.  I can attribute the squirelliness of the one board
to potential hardware trouble, but I'm still confused as to the
differences between HBDL, DLM, and DL.  Is it possible to get a hold of
the source code for these apps?

Thanks,

I didn't see the robot on the website I saw it in their catalog that
they included with the Stampbug that I bought. Try contacting them, they
may send you a catalog.

I have a Cirrus Cs-20 BB Sub-Micro Servo that I have been using for testing.  I 
was wondering how this servo compares to others like Futuba and others.  
Since I know how this one behaves, I can use that info as a comparrison.

What Futuba mode is closest to this one? (11 oz-in at 4.8v)

Thanks

Anyone know where to get the one for the HB.  I cannot find it anywhere.  I 
would like to find a place that actually has them.

Is the ir emitter on the handyboard just a standard red led? Is it efficient at
emitting in the IR range. Are there better emitters? I want to build an emitter
and detector set and have studied the multiplexing circuit posted. It uses the
same LED. The circuit doesn't give a part number for the Sharp detector. Does
some one know what it is, what are some of the other detectors that can be
used.

Hi!

    I am now modifying my old r/c truck to control it
with the handyboard, but I want a circuit that will
enable the receiver to control the servos when there
is an output received from the radio control and to
enable the handyboard to control when not output
is detected from the receiver.

    I will then be able to control the r/c truck in case
my programs are not well tune...

    I do have an idea how to do so, but I am wondering
where can I trigger in the receiver to know if there is
a reception of a command or not to enable/desable?

    If any of you have a plan of a futaba receiver, please
contact me.

Thanks!

Sebastien Verreault

I believe you have the IR output indicator confused with the emmitter
driver.  The red LED indicates that IR output is being transmitted. (That
is...if you have an external IR LED attached to the HB.) There is a header
for it.  

You can get a detector from Radio Shack.

Hi!
What do I do wrong?
I cannot run sony-ir.icb because if I try to do so, IC crashes
immediately and I get the message: Fatal internal error, illegal line in
s19 file.

I use IC 2.85 (June 94) and the smooth PWM-routines and I made sure I
use the right pcode_hb.s19 files and r22_ir.lis is not loaded.
It doesn't work on either of my two handyboards which both run fine
otherwise.
Any help very much appreciated!

You can try also the Kodenshi PIC12043. It is probably easier to find and is
100% pin and function compatible with the Sharp demodulator. I bought mine from
Farnell Components..

I am trying to transfer large amount of data to a computer from the Handy
Board as it collects that data from the sensors connected to it. I have a
choice of either a windows or a unix machine. I was wondering if anyone
has used the Handy Board for that and if so what is the optimal way to
run the transfer. My goal is to save that data in a file for later use.

Thanx in advance

http://www.cctc.demon.co.uk/stepper.htm=20

To the people who have told me about this, or have used this method to co=
ntrol steppers: please tell me how well you have gotten your motors worki=
ng. I have tried the sample code and my motors are a little sketchy. When=
 they first power up, they jerk left or right a little, causing my robot =
to align incorrectly. Also on the turns they sometimes jerk a little caus=
ing my turns to be thrown off.

...all stepper people *HELP ME* !=20

Thanks in advance,

from an interrupt code, is it possible to 'JMP' or 'JSR' to a
subroutine(function) written in C code?  what i am trying to do is the
following:  in the TOC4INT interrupt routine, be able to call in a C function.
i know that functions are called subroutines in assembler, but i tried the
following instruction in the interrupt code, and i could not get very far: 
 "JSR   subroutine_function"  
where "function" was the name of the function that i wanted to call.  is there
any way that i may do this, and if so, how do i "# INCLUDE" the code that
holds the C function that i am trying to call?  i never actually got far, the
assemler (as11_ic) did not allow me to compile the .asm code for reason that
it could not find the source of C code that was in the '# INCLUDE' statement,
however, the path was specified correctly.  there must be a way to do this.
thanks in advance.

Subject: connecting flash to 68hc11F1
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

Hello all,

I'm using th e68hc11F1 micro and want to connect an AM29f010 flash to it.
I'm configured in a way that i first have 32 K ram and the 32K flash.

I'm not sure how to connect the ~OE (low aactive) ~CE and ~WE. to any of the rw chip select lines of the 68hc11.

I'm running on 16 Mhz.

I'v tried some things but i don't seem to get it running.

The ram works fine, but when trying to program the flash it doesn't
work.

Has anybody done this before or have some schematics.

Thanks

Richard
Software engineer.

Subject: pyroelectric_sensor
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

Hello,
despite the fact of not using a handyboard, I do like to make small robot-like
projects. Instead of a Handyboard I use other microcontrollers, but that makes
no difference for my question. I am curious about the use of pyroelectricsensors, 
how do the current systems work, what are the possibillities and what is
the range of detecting an heatsource of let's say a candle.

My questions is simple, who has schematics for pyroelectric sensors or who
knows how to connect them. The type of sensor is not important as long as
the final output can give me an analog signal, which is proportinal to the
heatsource detected (or distance, if the source is always the same).
Please do not hassitate to reply because even the smallest suggestion could
give me a lead or clue to solve the problem. Do not be afraid that your
sollution is to complex, and that i do not understand, because I 'm an 
Electronic engineer and always prepared to invest time to crack the case.

Thanks for your reply, J. Derogee

I use the handyboard in the same way, and i need to say you, if you use d=
os
can get more avaibility for the serial port, what under a seudo multitask=
ing
enviroment like windows 95. Otherwise, i use windows 95 because i need th=
e
GUI interface to sell my product to my customers!!!
Hard election , really?
If you want better response , also can changes the crystal in the handybo=
ard
for other fecuency (i don't remember if 7.xxxx or 9.xxxxx, ask Fred) and =
get
19.200 or better serial port bauds per second.
Hope that help.

Hi,
I just received my Handyboard and i'm trying (hard) to get it working.
Tried to download the pcode_h.s19 using both the windows downloader and the
dosload 'dl.exe' windows one works OK, the dos one works OK but in full dos
mode without the windows. When i reset the board by switching of/on nothing
happens, and the display just lights barely the top row of the lcd with full
matrix.( no data)
When I run the IC program it say's cant connect to the board.

All help is appreciated.
Would like to get started this WK-end (I hope :-))

I have had the same sort of problems; my guess is that the 68HC11 itself
sometimes needs to be "slapped around" initially to properly initialize, and
DL, full screen, seems to do it best.

"slapped around", is that a term they teach at School of Engineering and 
Computer Science:-)

I doubt if the problem is with the 68HC11.  H/W and S/W usually work 
consistantly, as designed.  Working with Windows/DOS apps are a different 
story.

I use HBDL and it works every time on my PC.

If I'm not confused, I remeber seeing an article on pyroelectric sensors
in the new magazine "Robot Science & Technology" (Someone please verify).
It is still only up to it's premier issue so you can probably still
request it.
http://www.robotmag.com/index.html
Even if the article I remember is not in this issue, it would be great to
look into this magazine anyway.  The magazine is targeted to "educational
and hobby" robotics...people like us.  Maybe it would suit you.

Luc,

it sounds like its not downloading at all.  make sure the port you are using
is not disconnected internally, such as when you are trying to use com2 and
the internal modem is configured to use com2, usually com2 port is
disconnected for external use.  it sounds like the problem i was having, and
this is what was wrong.  i ended up having to use com1 which is used by the
mouse, and having to keep disconnecting the mouse when i wanted to download
and reconnecting it when i want to use the mouse.  a hassle, but the only way
that i can get mine to work without download problems.  dont forget to
configure "dl.exe" and "ic.exe" to use com1.  in this case however, since com1
is configured to run with the mouse, you have to "restart the computer in MS-
DOS mode" in the shutdown menu.  this is the dos that you must use.  when you
want to go back to windows, type "exit" and wait a minute.  a good text editor
is found by typing "edit" at the prompt, so once you get to programming, you
will not have to go to windows for a text editor.  you will know if it is
downloading for sure if the green light on the HB blinks very fast, and almost
looks like it is ON.  if this is not happening, then you are not downloading,
no matter what the program says.  let me know how it turns out.

Its my code and you are quite right - it is not the best in the world.
It was only intended to illustrate a point and I have done no more work
on it since then - sorry.

When first powered up the steppers will align themselves according to
the pattern sent to them so there will almost certainly be a little
shuffling around as they take up their detent positions. Half stepping
the motors will probably reduce the effect. If initial alignment is a
particular problem for you - as it might be in a competition say - then
you might like to power up the motors, position the robot then power
them down.

As for turns, I don't really know the answer. Bear in mind though that
the timing of motor pulses is important for reliable operation of the
steppers, especially at high speeds. If you want to drive the steppers
faster you will probably need to hook into the system interrupt (I don't
know how) and ensure that the motor signals are sent at well defined
intervals. I would expect system interrupts to interfere with the timing
in the sample code.

Assuming you mean R/C model servos, take a look at the Futaba servos for
sail boat winches.

Stock 
Number       Description             Torque     Speed  Weight  Dimensions  
FUTM0099  S5801 Sail Winch  136.0 oz.  .5/turn  2.9 oz.  1.81 x 0.98 x 1.73
in. 

Looking at the spec sheet for speed (taken from  Futaba's web site) it says
.5seconds per turn. You might want to call your local hobby store and
verify what that actually means. I haven't seen or used one before.

or take a look at this page I wrote up awhile back to modify a servo for
360 rotation

A few weeks back I was a little dissapointed in the performance of the QT=
 refective optosensors which come with the Handy Board because when using=
 them on the digital inputs, their range was only 1/4 to 1/2 inch or less.

Some people told me to use the Radio Shack type Infrared modules. This wa=
s something I really frowned upon because I needed 5 sets of sensors, so =
this would add up to alot of space.

If anyone is interested in using sensors on the digital inputs here's a w=
ay to get a range of 3 to 3 1/2 inches, as opposed to 1/4 inch.

-----

I constructed my own sensor/emitter pairs from the following two Digikey =
parts:

L14N2QT-ND  Infrared photo transistor
LN66-ND     Infrared LED

The transistor is a 3 legged version so I removed the Base leg. Although =
if you keep it on, you can attach a potentiometer to it and vary the sens=
itivity of the sensor.  (something I havent played with yet)

*also please note the emitter and collector legs are swapped, the emitter=
 is the leg with the tab on the outside of the can.

The wiring is straight forward. I used the same approach shown in the Han=
dy Board manual. The emitter was grounded, collector was wired to the sig=
nal input, and the LED was limited with a 330 ohm resistor.

----

Anything within 3 to 3 1/2 inches gives a true result (0), everything els=
e give a false (1). The numbers are swapped but it works.  :)


Hope someone finds this useful.

Hi Luc,

yesterday i had the same problem with my notebook (W95). I can=B4t downlo=
ad to my
hb during a session in a full dos-window.
With the "MSD.EXE" Programm i found out, i haven=B4t any COM-Ports (?????=
). I must
configure all COM-PORTS new. After this
procedure it works fine.

does anyone know if a piece of assembler code can call in C functions?  i
would imagine that it would be done using a "JSR" instruction.  this message
goes out especially to Fred Martin.
thanks in advance.

Hello, I was wondering if anybody has tried out Colby Leiders midilib for
the handyboard? I have problems downloading it to the handyboard (syntax
errors in some of the files according to the IC downloader).

Hello,

Thanks again for the help, but still i have problems getting the HB to talk
to me.
The com ports work, as the download led lights, and the boards does act
different after a download.
Could it be that the RAM is brooken and gives these erratic results ?
Hope to get the thingy talking without returning it to the states.

Most of the commercial telecommunication packages can log incoming data from
the com port to a file. Most freeware and shareware versions also do this.

Pleas ere-read the answer. If i have a programa sending data to the serial
com port, nobody can open that port to log into a file! What he want is some
to do that (two programs reading the sam port).
I search some like that, and found a shareware package called: comtap. It
allow to build a wire between you serial port and the device to be atachhed
to the serial port, and monitor all tha activity. If you want that pealse
e-mail me.

Hi there, I am having some strange downloading problems.  I have had my 
handyboard working in the past but cannot get ti to work now.  I am using 
a macintosh with the lastest version of the mac downloader.  The first 
segment of the downloading goes fine and the second stage where it loads 
 the pcode to the handyboard almost completes.  The downloading gets to 
7360 bytes instead of something like 7500.  An error message comes up and 
says that the bytes programmed does not match the bytes sent and to check 
the power on the board because low power conditions can cause memory 
errors.  I have checked through the board quite carefully.  The only 
things that I think could be wrong are that the voltage at pin 28 of the 
memory chip is 5.2 volts.  Is this a problem? 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks

check that your pcodeb.s19 file is not corrupted (i.e. get a fresh
copy from the web site)

it is possible that you have a RAM failure.

This question has nothing to do with the Handy Board
although it is a general question which I need some
help with.

Previous students at the school I attend left behind=20
a robot which they worked on. The microcontroller was
Intel's 80C196. The microcontroller is shot however,=20
so we need to get a replacement. It is offered in both
16 and 20 MHz versions. The original used in the robot
was the 16 MHz version, however we can only find the=20
20 MHz version now.

If I was to replace the 16 MHz controller with a=20
20 MHz version would it affect any of the programming?
What would some effects be if any?

Maybe direct help some of you big microcontroller=20
gurus would be best. (Fred, Randy,... hint,hint)  :)

Thanks in advance,

Subject: Poloroid sonar interface
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi
I'm tring to get a Poloroid sonar unit to work so that I can interface
this to my finger board. First I'm tring to get the sonar tested. I
followed the instructions at
http://incolor.inetnebr.com/bill_r/polaroid%20sonar%20mod.htm. I have
this circuit bread boarded. I made the modifications as shown. Now how
do I know if this is working? I know that I trigger this with a +5v
signal to pin 9. This should send out the signal on XLOG (this shoul go
low) Then when an ecco is received MFLOG goes low. My questions
1    How long do you apply the +5 to pin9?
2    Does XLOG go low and stay low? Is this just a pulse low?
3     Does MFLOG go low and stay?
Any other help in testing this circuit will be great! If I'm not giving
enough detail to help please let me know. Thank you

Hi

Replacing the 16MHz version with the 20 Mhz CPU would affect only the
timer speed of the internal timers.
We are using the MC and MD versoon of the 196.
Connected to those timers are about the following :

-PWM 1 & 2
-Wavegenerator (if it has one)
- timer unit (capture and compare unit)
- counters
- serial interface (UARTS)

Maybe there is more, but at this time a can't think of any.

What your main problem will be if using motion control is that your pwm
will run at a 25% higher speed and the time critical stuff relaying on
the timer structure. Further any real tme interrupts will run 25%
faster.  Speed measurement using the timers will go wrong by 25%.

You may have to change all the above to be sure your system doesn't do
strange things.

Hope this helps a little.

If they replace the controller on their board with a chip that is rated a=
t
20MHz but they are still using the old board with its 16MHz oscillator
won't it still run at 16MHz?

Subject: Walking Robot Question
Priority: normal
X-Mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v3.01a)

I'm wondering how the servos are controlled on a walking robot.  

I would imagine that multiple legs would have to be moved simultaneously and 
in sync with each other.  If servos are changed one-at-a-time then one leg 
would be dragging the others.  A design that can control multiple servos but 
only by changing them one-at-a-time seems like one that is not suited for 
walking robots. 

What kind of a controller would be used to manage this?  Have I overlooked 
something?

Mike,
	I have mentioned before that I am going to use a Novasoft MSCC11 board
with an HC811E2 (which has 8K EEPROM on board) and a piece of software
called Robobug which uses all 16 of the i/o pins to control 16 servos.
These servos are all controlled at the same time, I would have to
re-read the info to tell you how but it appears to work. Email me if you
want any more info and I'll dig it out (along with a copy of the
software and documentation if you want it.

Subject: Cirrus Servos - Question - How do they rate compared to Futaba
Priority: normal
X-Mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v3.01a)


I have a Cirrus Cs-20 BB Sub-Micro Servo that I have been using for testing.  I 
was wondering how this servo compares to others like Futuba and others.  
Since I know how this one behaves, I can use that info as a comparrison.

What Futuba mode is closest to this one? (11 oz-in at 4.8v)

Are there any dasheets for Futaba or Cirrus on the web?

Thanks

Those of you in the States might have caught today's issue of 
USA Today, which has a cover story on the Media Lab's research, 
including a photo of yours truly and a few paragraphs about the
LEGO Mindstorms Robotics Invention System.

there's a web link at  http://www.usatoday.com/news/acovmon.htm .
see also http://www.usatoday.com/news/nds32.htm for the blurb
about my stuff.

anyway, it's pretty exciting, and thought some of you might be
interested :-).

Fred

Subject: Sony IR Encoding Question - Sources

Does anyone know if there is a chip or software to allow the creation of
Sony Encoded IR signals.  

Since there IS software to decode Sony IR, I would like to be able to
generate, via computer, this Sony IR rather than using a Remote Control
device.

Any help would be appreciated.

Hi Skye,

I play in this time also with voice recognicition chips (and voice record +
playback
also for my rug warrior like bot) and I found two of them very interesting:
the first
is the MSM6679A-110 manufactured by OKI. This is a very large chip with 84
Pins
(PLCC) but he includes voice record and playback also and is relatively
difficult to
program. The second one is the HM2007 manufactured by HMC (this is Hualon
Microelectronics in Taiwan), this is a very simple chip but very good for
robotics.
Check out the following sites also, they are very interesting:
http://www.seattlerobotics.org/encoder/jul97/gensys.html and
http://www.the4cs.com/~corin/cse477/toaster/

Cheers Erwin
