Hi

I suggest that you contact ImageCraft.
http://www.imagecraft.com/software/index.html  or  info@imagecraft.com 

They have a C compiler for 68HC11 CPU's that will do what you want, including a
library for the HandyBoard (see attached e-mail) !

I have no affiliation with ImageCraft (other than as a satisfied customer).

Hope this helps
Scott

At long last, I dusted off Chuck McManis Handyboard library and ported it
to V5. No reason why it can't work with V4.5 either ;-) Anyway, to try it
out, point your browser to

ftp://ftp.imagecraft.com/pub/libhb.zip

Chuck really did a great job with the LCD. There are commands to scroll,
move etc. Make sure you try the lcdtest2.c test.

Subject: serial library for C++ 
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hello,
	I have a handy board with poloroid transducers and I am trying use the
results of my distance measurments in a C++ program on the computer.  I
have found programs on the handyboard web page that should alow the
handyboard to transmit information over the serial line.  What I am looking
for is if anyone knows were I could find a serial for Microsofts
Visual C++ 5.0.  I would like to find one that is free or sharware but any
information on any serial that will work would be appreciated.
Thanks.
Mark Wallace
