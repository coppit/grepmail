usage:

  grepmail [--help|--version] [-abBDFhHilLmrRuvVw] [-C <cache-file>]
    [-j <status>] [-s <sizespec>] [-d <date-specification>]
    [-X <signature-pattern>] [-Y <header-pattern>]
    [-e] <pattern> <files...>

  grepmail [--help|--version] [-abBDFhHilLmrRuvVw] [-C <cache-file>]
    [-j <status>] [-s <sizespec>] [-d <date-specification>]
    [-X <signature-pattern>] [-Y <header-pattern>]
    -E <expr> <files...>

  grepmail [--help|--version] [-abBDFhHilLmrRuvVw] [-C <cache-file>]
    [-j <status>] [-s <sizespec>] [-d <date-specification>]
    [-X <signature-pattern>] [-Y <header-pattern>]
    -f <pattern-file> <files...>

At least one of -s, -d, -u, -e, and -E must be specified, and can appear in
any relative order following the other flags. The -e flag is optional if
pattern appears immediately before -s or -d. Files can be plain ASCII or ASCII
files compressed with gzip, bzip2, lzip, or xz. -E allows for complex pattern
matches involving logical operators. If no file is provided, normal or
compressed ASCII input is taken from STDIN.

-a Use received date instead of sent date for -d matching
-b Search must match body
-B Print message bodies but with only limited headers
-C Specify the location of the cache file
-d Specify a required date range (see below)
-D Debug mode
-e Explicitly name pattern (when searching for strings beginning with "-")
-E Specify a complex search expression
-f Read patterns from a file
-F Force processing of all data as mailboxes
-h Search must match header
-H Print headers but not bodies of matching emails
-i Ignore case in the search expression
-j Search must match status (A=answered, R=read, D=deleted, O=old, F=flagged)
-l Output the names of files having an email matching the expression
-L Follow symbolic links (implies -R)
-M Do not search non-text mime attachments
-m Append "X-Mailfolder: <folder>" to all headers to indicate in which folder
   the match occurred
-n Print the line number info (and filename if necessary) for the emails
-q Quiet mode -- don't output warnings
-r Output the names of the files and the number of emails matching the
   expression
-R Recurse directories
-s Specify a size range in bytes (see below)
-S Ignore signatures
-u Ensure that no duplicate emails are output
-v Output emails that don't match the expression
-V Display the version number
-w Match word boundaries
-X Specify a regular expression for the signature separator
-Y Specify a header to search (implies -h)
--help Print a help message

Date constraints require Date::Parse. Date specifications must be of the
form of:
- a date like "today", "1st thursday in June 1992" (requires Date::Manip),
  "05/18/93", "12:30 Dec 12th 1880", "8:00pm december tenth",
- "before", "after", or "since", followed by a date as defined above,
- "between <date> and <date>", where <date> is defined as above.

Size constraints must be of the form of:
- 12345: match size of exactly 12345
- <12345, <=12345, >12345, >=12345: match size less than, less than or equal,
  greater than, or greater than or equal to 12345
- 10000-12345: match size between 10000 and 12345 inclusive
