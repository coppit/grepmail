Hello,
	I have a handyboard and 6500 series poloroid ultrasonic ranging
system.  I have downloaded the sonar.c programs used to drive the
transducer for distance measurements.  There appears to be a problem, or
atleast I think there is, with it.  The sonar device is supposed to give
distances of up to 35ft but the TCNC time register is 16 bit and in the
program it says "if ((peekwork(0x100e)-start_time) < 0)" too much time has
elapsed and it returns -1.  Therefore as soon as about 32700 counts goes
by, that value will go negative. I believe hex goes from 0 to 32768 then
-32768 to -1. In this case the difference will be < 0 if the object
is greater then about 9 ft.  I have taken this out of the program and can
get accurate measurements up to atleast 30 ft but I have to look at the
value given and add multiples of 2^16 to it to figure out where it is.
Taking this out of the program also can get you stuck if you really are
out of range.
	I have looked on the motorola web pages to see about this clock
and it says that the clock goes till it reachs $ffff and then flags
somewhere that there is an overflow and then starts over.  I don't know
how to find out were in the chip this information might be stored.  I know
the TCNT time register is at 0x100e from the notes on Simplified Sonar for
the Handy Board but I don't know where that overflow flag is stored.  I
thought that maybe by setting this flag and using it in the loop you might
be about to get a greater distance out of you measurement.
	Another question I have is about IC.  I would like to display
numbers greater then 32000 and right now there are several int type
variables and normal C comands don't seem to work to make a "long" or any
other type that are larger then 32000.  How does IC handle larger numbers?
	I am only a student and don't have much experience with this stuff
so I would appreciate any feedback I can get on either of these problems.
Thanks.

	I had this same problem when I got mine a few weeks ago.  I ended up
putting a capacitor from pin 1 to pin 3 on U2 of the sonar driver board.
I also had to take out the 1k resistor from the BINH.  It kept
BINH at 1 V instead of Zero and that seamed to cause problems.
	As for the 6 ft problem,  it should be closer to 9 ft.  I think
the problem there is the IC code you used.  If you used the code for
SONAR.C from the HB web site then there is a problem with it.  What that
program does is take the difference in time from the internal clock.  the
problem is that in the code it says that if the difference between start
time and currnet time is negative too much time has elapsed.  Well,  this
has a 16 bit counter so when the difference is greater the about 32,700 it
becomes negative.  If you do the math, that means at about 9 ft that
happens so it tell you you are out of range.  
	The way I fixed this was to slow the clock down.
	
I looked up information on the motorola web page and found where the
prescalers were for the clock. 
	If you want to slow it down by a factor of four you can just add
this line to you program in sonar_init()

	bit_set(0x1024, 1);

I believe bit_set(0x1024, 2); will slow it down by a factor of 8 and
bit_set(0x1024, 3); will slow it down by a factor of 16.  
	There are better ways of fixing this problem but they appear much
more complicated.  For example the motorola chip has an overflow flag that
says when the internal clock flips.  You could incorporate that into your
code instead of slowing the clock down.  Good luck and I hope this helps.

Hello,
	I have a handy board with poloroid transducers and I am trying use the
results of my distance measurments in a C++ program on the computer.  I
have found programs on the handyboard web page that should alow the
handyboard to transmit information over the serial line.  What I am looking
for is if anyone knows were I could find a serial for Microsofts
Visual C++ 5.0.  I would like to find one that is free or sharware but any
information on any serial that will work would be appreciated.
Thanks.

  Check out this site.  It works well.  The only problem I had was timing
issues when trying to read and write to the port too quickly.
