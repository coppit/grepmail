  Tassilo von Parseval <tassilo.von.parseval@rwth-aachen.de> for the bug
  report)
- Cleaned up code a bit

Version 5.30.2:
- Switched to Test::More for better test reporting

Version 5.30.1: Thu Sep 16 2004
- Fixed Date::Manip parsing of single-point times such as "today". (Bug found
  by Marten van Wezel <puntloos@users.sourceforge.net>)
- Changed Makefile.PL to use Module::Install
- Changed version numbering
- Dropped Benchmark::Timer from the distribution, since the updated version
  has been released

New in version 5.30:

  directories in t/mailboxes/directory. (Thanks to Joey Hess
  <joey@kitenet.net> for the feature suggestion and initial patch.)
- Updated t/invalid_mailbox.t to be more robust. (Thanks to an anonymous bug
  report on SourceForge.)
- Fixed a bug in t/invalid_mailbox.t for Solaris. (Thanks to Jost Krieger
  <Jost.Krieger+smokeback@sunu991.rz.ruhr-uni-bochum.de> for the bug report.)

  Hosken <martin_hosken@sil.org> for the initial patch.) Requires
  Mail::Mbox::MessageParser 1.20 or better now.
- Changed single dates so that they are treated as inferred spans, instead of
  a single day. For example "2004" now means "between Jan 1 2004 and Jan 1
  2005" instead of "between Jan 1 2004 and Jan 2 2004". (Thanks to Dan Pritts
  <danno@internet2.edu> for the feature suggestion.)

New in version 5.23:
- Updated test cases to run under Windows.
- Fixed a bug in speed tests which would cause the grep implementation to
  fail.
- Fixed incorrect output for emails without message bodies. (Thanks to Volker
  Kuhlmann <VolkerKuhlmann@gmx.de> for the bug report.)
- Fixed filename output for -n, -m and other situations when input comes from
  standard input. (Thanks to an anonymous submittor on SourceForge for an
  initial patch.)
- Added -w flag to match word boundaries. (Thanks to Ed Avis
  <epaepa@users.sourceforge.net> for the feature request.)
- A warning is now issued and caching is disabled if -C is not specified and
  $HOME is not set (as might be the case when running grepmail in a cron job).
  (Thanks to Dr. Oliver Muth <Dr.O.Muth@gmx.de> for the bug report.)

New in version 5.22:
- X-Mailfolder header no longer has a line number when -n is used. (bugfix by
  Kevin Pfeiffer <pfeiffer@iu-bremen.de>)
- New -B flag prints abbreviated headers (initial patch by Kevin Pfeiffer
  <pfeiffer@iu-bremen.de>)
- Headers spanning multiple lines are now printed correctly in warnings and
  such.
- Fixed a spurious warning which would be printed if caching was not enabled.
- grepmail will now disable caching if the caching version of
  Mail::Mbox::MessageParser can not be loaded, instead of exiting.

New in version 5.21:
- Fixed line ending bugs under MS-DOS/Windows.

New in version 5.20:
- Added speed testing to the distribution
- Fixed Makefile.PL so that test modules would not be installed.
- Changed testing to use PERLRUN instead of FULLPERLRUN, which is not
  available with older versions of MakeMaker that ship with older versions of
  Perl. (Thanks to Ed Avis <ed.avis@kbcfp.com> for catching this.)
- Fixed interactive installation problems. (Thanks to Joey Hess
  <joeyh@debian.org> for catching this (again).)
- Fixed broken searching of $HOME/mail, $HOME/Mail, and $HOME/Mailbox
  directories when a mail folder can not be found. Changed $MAIL to $MAILDIR
  since $MAIL usually points to the user's inbox. (Bug found and initial patch
  by Peter Cordes <peter@llama.nslug.ns.ca>.)
- Cache file permissions are now set to protect against prying eyes. (Patch by
  Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>)
- The user can now specify the cache file location with the -C flag.
- Fixed compatibility problems with perl 5.005_01

New in version 5.10:
- Extracted mail parsing into the new Mail::Mbox::MessageParser module.
- Fixed small performance loss bugs in short-circuit matching of headers which
  were introduced in the last version
- Fixed some uses of uninitialized values (Originally reported by Ed Avis
  <ed.avis@kbcfp.com>.)
- Improved performance a bit.
- The Makefile.PL now uses the default values when run non-interactively.
- Caching is now enabled by default. (It's no longer experimental.) Users can
  disable it during installation.
- Date specifications without times (e.g. "today") are interpreted as midnight
  of the given day instead of the current time of that day. grepmail now
  relies on Date::Manip to handle this--users must upgrade Date::Manip to get
  this support. (Thanks to Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org> for working with
  Sullivan Beck <sbeck@cise.ufl.edu> to get TodayIsMidnight added to
  Date::Manip. Original bug report by Philip Douglass
  <philipsd@users.sourceforge.net>)
- Restructured test cases

New in version 5.00:
- grepmail is now orders of magnitude faster for mailboxes which have very
  large (>30MB) emails in them
- "grep" is now used to find the start of emails, if it is installed. For
  mailboxes with large emails in them, this can speed things up by about 5x.
- Reduced memory consumption by about 3 times.
- -- now marks the end of options and the beginning of folders (Thanks to
  Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org> for the idea.)
- -f now reads patterns from a file like GNU grep does. (Feature suggestion by
  Darxus@chaosreigns.com) -j is now used for status
- Added smail compatibility. (Thanks to Roy <qroy@ghg.net> for the patch.)
- The "**" prefix on warnings has been changed to "grepmail:"
- Date specifications without times (e.g. "today") are interpreted as midnight
  of the given day instead of the current time of that day. (Bugfix and
  initial patch by Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>.)
- Fixed -i when used with -Y--it was always case sensitive. (Bugfix by Michael
  C. Toren <mct@toren.net>)
- Updated t/functionality.t to avoid running gzip-related test cases when gzip
  is not installed on the system.
- Improved some error messages so that they prepend "grepmail: " as they
  should
- Cleaned up some warnings about ambiguous hash values (Thanks to Philip
  Douglass <philipsd@sf.net> for pointing them out in a bug report.)
- Added a warning about the version of perl required for new pattern features
  (Thanks to Philip Douglass <philipsd@sf.net> for the bug report.)
- -t flag is now -j
- Fixed broken Gnus support
- Improved test case for Gnus

New in version 4.91:
- Added missing dependency for Storable.
- Storable now only necessary if you plan on using caching
- Fixed a bug in test case 83
- Changed -s to support "<", ">", "<=", ">=" and "-". (Feature suggestion by
  Jens Schleusener <Jens.Schleusener@debis-sfr.de>)

New in version 4.90:
- Made Mail::Folder::SlowReader object-oriented
- Removed FastReader from distribution. (It's no longer faster! Also, I
  couldn't integrate it easily with the new object-oriented reader design.)
- Fixed a bug where in some cases emails were not being converted to mbox
  format before being printed
- Made searches involving header-related constraints a bit faster
- Added missing documentation for -F flag
- Added -f flag to search based on message status. (Feature suggestion by
  Richard D Alloway <ralloway@winbeam.com>)
- Fixed a bug where -X and -Y flags after a pattern would not be processed
- Added experimental caching capability, which is perhaps 5% slower the first
  time you run grepmail on a mail folder, and 10-20% faster on subsequent
  runs. The cache is stored in ~/.grepmail-cache. You must edit the grepmail
  file and set $USE_CACHING to true to use this feature. (Idea and initial
  patch by terry jones <terry@eatoni.com>)

New in version 4.81:
- Fixed incompatibilities with older (5.005_03) versions of Perl
- Fixed test cases which fail on operating systems (shells?) which emit
  "Broken Pipe" to standard output. I'd rather break the pipe than have
  grepmail gobble megabytes of data when it can't handle it.
- Added --version flag (patch by Gerald Pfeifer <pfeifer@dbai.tuwien.ac.at>)
- Added documentation for -V flag.

New in version 4.80:
- Added prototype -E flag to support complex searches. (Thanks to Nelson Minar
  <nelson@monkey.org> for the original suggestion in Sep 2000, And terry jones
  <terry@eatoni.com> for seconding the idea.)
- Added -F flag to force processing of files which grepmail determines are not
  mailboxes. (feature suggested by terry jones <terry@eatoni.com>)
- Documentation updated to reflect that -B no longer exists. (By terry jones
  <terry@eatoni.com>)
- The test to determine if a file is a mailbox was improved to adhere better
  to RFC 822, while still providing some flexibility. (Initial suggestion and
  patch by terry jones <terry@eatoni.com>)
- Improved date extraction to also look at the 'From ' line when both the
  Received and Date headers fail. (patch by terry jones <terry@eatoni.com>)
- Fixed a long-standing bug in which filenames of compressed mailboxes which
  contained special shell characters would cause problems. (Thanks to Jost
  Krieger <jkrieger@users.sourceforge.net> for giving me the kick in the pants
  to finally fix this.)
- Fixed a long-standing bug in which grepmail would incorrectly report the
  filename of compressed mailboxes in error messages. (Thanks to Jost Krieger
  <jkrieger@users.sourceforge.net> for giving me the kick in the pants to
  finally fix this.)

New in version 4.72:
- 20% speed improvement in the Perl mailbox parser (By terry jones
  <terry@eatoni.com>)
- Fixed a number of potential bugs in command line processing and date
  processing. (By terry jones <terry@eatoni.com>)
- Cleaned up return values and use of quotes in the code. (By terry jones
  <terry@eatoni.com>)
- Fixed a bug in -X signature processing (By terry jones <terry@eatoni.com>)
- Modified anonymize_mailbox to anonymize To: and Subject: in the header.
  (Thanks to terry jones <terry@eatoni.com> for the idea.)
- Fixed a bug in FastReader where emails less than 255 characters in size
  would occasionally cause a core dump. (Thanks to terry jones
  <terry@eatoni.com> for submitting a bug report and sample mailbox.)
- Made "big" test mailboxes 4 times bigger for more meaningful speed tests

New in version 4.71:
- Fixed warning about SIGHUP on Windows.
- Fixed -u functionality for emails without the Message-Id header. (Thanks to
  Felix E. Klee <felix.klee@inka.de> for finding the bug.) NOTE: grepmail will
  use Digest::MD5 to compute a hash for the email header. If you don't have
  Digest::MD5, grepmail will just store the header. So, the default tradeoff
  is time for space.
- Fixed a bug in the test script. (Thanks to Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net> for
  finding and fixing the bug.)
- Extended workaround for spurious warning about undefined variable to Perl
  5.8. (Thanks to Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net> for reporting the ongoing
  heisenbug.)

New in version 4.7:
- Fixed signal handling to make grepmail easier to debug. Thanks to Ilya
  Zakharevich for providing the solution.
- Fixed a possible performance problem in reading of emails (Perl
  implementation), and documented the settings in the README.
- Expanded the pattern for matching the start of emails to allow different
  types of emails to be parsed.
- Fixed a bug where -R was reported as not recognized. (Thanks to Nicholas
  Riley <nriley@sf.net> for the bug report and fix.)
- "anonymize_mailbox" utility included to help people submit bug reports
- If a mailbox can not be found, grepmail now searches the $home/mail,
  $home/Mail, $home/Mailbox directories (or the directory specified by the
  MAIL environment variable). (Thanks to Michael Friendly <friendly@yorku.ca>
  for the feature suggestion and initial patch.)
- Added -X flag to allow the user to specify a pattern for the signature
  separator. (Thanks to Michael Friendly <friendly@yorku.ca> for the feature
  suggestion.)
- Added -Y flag to search specific headers. (Thanks to Terry Jones
  <terry@eatoni.com> for the idea to automatically wrap header lines as
  necessary.)

New in version 4.60:
- Removed -B flag and added -S flag. -B is now performed using -bS.
- Added installation flags to suppress interactive installation. (Thanks to
  Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net> for the problem report. He had to patch
  Makefile.PL for his Debian packaging.)
- Fixed a slow implementation of searching for signatures that would cause
  grepmail to crawl for very large emails. Thanks to Joey Hess
  <joey@kitenet.net> for discovering the inefficiency.
- Fixed a short-circuit which should have bypassed the search for signatures
  if -B was not specified. Thanks to Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net> for finding
  the bug.
- Implemented a new Perl parser which is 5% to 50% faster depending on how
  I/O-bound your system is.
- Restructured the code a bit and improved detection of invalid arguments.

New in version 4.51:
- grepmail now dies gracefully when invalid patterns like 'strcpy(' are
  supplied. (It should be 'strcpy\('.)
- Fixed a bug in attachment boundary matching which would cause the boundary
  match to fail if the boundary contained special pattern matching characters.
  (Thanks to Richard Everson <rme at users.sourceforge.net> for identifying
  the bug, and providing a sample email which demonstrates the problem.)
- Added a check for Inline 0.41 or better during "perl Makefile.PL" when
  Mail::Folder::FastReader is selected to be installed. (Thanks to Brian L.
  Johnson <blj8@blj8.com> for the problem report.)
- Fixed a bug where grepmail would fail to print matching emails which had
  signatures, and added a test case for it. This bug was introduced with -B
  support in version 4.49.  (A *huge* thanks to Moritz Barsnick
  <barsnick@gmx.net> for reporting the bug and doing the initial analysis of
  the cause.)
- Modified Makefile.PL to ask whether the user wants FastReader regardless of
  whether they specified arguments to "make Makefile.PL".
- Modified Makefile.PL to allow the user to interactively specify the
  installation path.
- Fixed a typo in debugging output for emails without "Date:" headers.
- Improved error messages.
- Usage message now displays just the flags, --help shows a summary of their
  meanings as well.

New in version 4.50:
- Added X-Draft-From to support newer versions of Gnus (Thanks to Nevin Kapur
  <nevin@jhu.edu> for the patch).

New in version 4.49:
- Fixed test cases to work around PATH modifications made by Date::Manip
- Added -B to search the body but not the signature. (Thanks to Helmut
  Springer <delta@faveve.uni-stuttgart.de> for the feature request.)
- Added LICENSE file. (Thanks to Janet Casey <jcasey@gnu.org> for the
  reminder.)

New in version 4.48:
- Mail::Folder::FastReader migrated from XS to Inline.
- -H flag added by Nevin Kapur <nevin@jhu.edu>
- Error messages are localized in test cases. (Thanks to cpan-testers and in
  particular Jost Krieger <Jost.Krieger@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> for finding this
  bug and diagnosing it.)
- Fixed a problem with timezones in the test cases. (Thanks to Roy Lanek
  <lanek@ranahminang.net> for helping me debug this.)
- Added a check in the test cases for determining if the user's timezone is
  not recognized by Date::Manip.

New in version 4.47:
- Grepmail now converts Gnus emails into mbox emails before printing them.
  (Thanks to Johan Vromans <JVromans@squirrel.nl> for supplying a patch and
  explaining the need for it.
- Fixed a couple bugs in -M processing
- -M is now 19% faster. (It's now only about 9% slower than without -M.)

New in version 4.46:
- Fixed a bug in -u message id processing. (Thanks go to an anonymous bug
  reporter on SourceForge.)
- Added more workarounds to prevent warnings resulting from a bug in Perl 5.6
  (Thanks to Joey Hess <joey@kitenet.net>)
- Added -Z flag to tell grepmail not to use Mail::Folder::FastReader even if
  it is installed.
- Fixed a bug introduced in version 4.44 where -m would not work unless used
  with -n. (Thanks to Imre Simon <is@ime.usp.br> for catching this.)
- --help anywhere on the command line now causes the help to be printed,
  instead of only when used as the first argument.
- Test script now exercises both the Mail::Folder::FastReader and perl mailbox
  implementations as appropriate.
- Restructured code to separate out Perl mailbox implementation as
  Mail::Folder::SlowReader. (This module is embedded in the grepmail script.)

New in version 4.45:
- Added -n and -V to usage message. (Thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald
  <WRohdewald@dplanet.ch> for catching this.)
- Added workarounds to prevent warnings resulting from a bug in Perl 5.6
- A blank line before the start of an email is not required now. This
  allows broken folders created by Netscape to be read. (Thanks to Jeremy
  Malcolm <terminus@terminus.net.au> for the bug report.)
- Mail::FastReader is 8% faster.

New in version 4.44:
- execution with -M flag now 35% faster
- Added a Mail::Folder::FastReader module which can cause grepmail to
  run 10-40% faster, depending on your system. Since this module is
  experimental, the installation script will allow you to not install
  the module. A C compiler is required.
- "-----Original Message-----" now recognized as beginning an included
  message
- Fixed a bug where errors would not be displayed if compressed data
  was piped to grepmail
- Date::Parse is now only required if -d is used. (Date::Manip is
  still only required if you use complex date specfications.) (Thanks
  to Richard Stallman <rms@gnu.org> for pointing this out.)
- Added -n flag to print line numbers a la grep. (Thanks to Richard
  Stallman <rms@gnu.org> for the suggestion)
- Fixed a bug in debug output where the email subject was actually the
  sender
- Fixed an undefined value in the printing of flag information
- An ASCII file is now determined to be a mailbox if it has a line
  whose prefix is 'From' or 'X-From-Line:', and another line whose
  prefix is 'Received ', 'Date:', 'Subject:', 'X-Status:', or
  'Status:'.
- Error exits now return 1 (Thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald
  <WRohdewald@dplanet.ch> for the bug report)
- -V flag prints the version (Thanks to Wolfgang Rohdewald
  <WRohdewald@dplanet.ch> for the feature request)
- Restructured code: localized reading of the emails from the file,
  removed two functions

New in version 4.43:
- Fixed a bug in -r counting when used with -h. (Thanks to Andrew
  <andrew@ugh.net.au> for the bug report.)
- Fixed a bug in the handling of included messages. (Thanks to Antoine
  Martin <antonus@libertysurf.fr> for the bug report and suggestion
  for the fix.)

New in version 4.42:
- Added -a flag to use received date instead of sent date for -d matches.
  (Thanks to Michael Liljeblad <liljeblad at users.sourceforge.net> for the
  patch.)
- Included emails are now ignored properly (Thanks to an anonymous submittor 
  for the bug report and part of a patch
  https://sourceforge.net/bugs/?func=detailbug&bug_id=112159&group_id=2207)
- If an email has no date, the -d switch now issues a warning and does not
  treat the email as a match (Thanks to David Blaine <blained at
  users.sourceforge.net> for the bug report.)
- -d "" can be used to find emails without dates
- Mailbox files are now detected as files using
  if ($buffer =~ /^(X-From-Line:|From) /im && $buffer =~ /^Subject: /im)
  rather than
  if ($buffer =~ /^(X-From-Line:|From) /im && $buffer =~ /^Date: /im)
- Improved detection of binary files. (Thanks to Dan Sugalski
  <dan@tuatha.sidhe.org> for the sample code.)
- STDERR and STDOUT now checked separately during "make test"
- Headers can now be in the format "Date:<tab>" in addition to "Date: "
  (Thanks to Benjamin Korvemaker <korvemaker at users.sourceforge.net> for the
  patch and concept.)

New in version 4.41:
- Support for Gnus-style mail files added (Thanks to Werner Bosse
  <Werner.Bosse@alcatel.de> for the patch.)
- Test mail files tweaked to make the test cases work better across all time
  zones. (Thanks to Andreas Kutschera <Andreas.Kutschera@bln.siemens.de> for
  the patch.)
- Added check for unparsable dates in email headers.
- Fixed a Perl warning raised when date parsing fails.
- Added instructions for getting the necessary modules to README.

New in version 4.40:
- Date::Parse and Date::Manip version unified -- Date::Parse is now required,
  and Date::Manip (if present) is used to parse complex dates. (Patch by
  Seth Cohn <sethcohn@users.sourceforge.net>, modified by David Coppit)

New in version 4.31:
- Distro has missing test cases for -u functionality. Doh!

New in version 4.30:
- Updated code to avoid warnings under Perl 5.6 (Thanks to Andreas Kutschera
  <Andreas.Kutschera@bln.siemens.de> for the bug report.)

  be tested even though the programs were available. (Thanks to Andreas
  Kutschera <Andreas.Kutschera@bln.siemens.de> for the patch.)
- Added standard --help flag (Patch by Seth Cohn <seth@users.sourceforge.net>)

  output. (A BIG thanks to Seth Cohn <seth@users.sourceforge.net>.)

New in version 4.23:
- Updated the test cases to work better in timezones close to +0000 and +2300.
  (email if you have problems with tests 1 and 23. Thanks to Harald Krause

  system.
- The code has been restructured to compile more easily with perlcc.

New in version 4.21:
- Fixed a bug that would cause grepmail to runaway when a pipe following it
  was broken. (Thanks to Gerald Pfeifer <pfeifer@dbai.tuwien.ac.at> for the
  bug report)

New in version 4.20:
- grepmail development has been moved to SourceForge, and made public. Visit
  http://grepmail.sourceforge.net/
- Added -s flag, which limits matched emails to a given size
- Restructured the code to be more robust with respect to feature interaction.
  (At a 5-10% slowdown cost.)
- Fixed an uninitialized variable warning caused by emails without subjects in
  debug mode.

New in version 4.11:
- Fixed a bug where an ASCII file would not be recognized as a mailbox when
  the first couple emails did not have a "From:" line. (Thanks to Jeff Flowers
  <jeff.flowers@npl.co.uk>)
- Added standard Perl testing.

New in version 4.1:
- Stripped auto-perl execution code, since it never works on all platforms.
  (Installation instructions modified to require the user to fix the #! line.)
- Minor changes to allow grepmail to run without -w complaints.

New in version 4.0:
- Fixed a bug where shell characters needed to be escaped for compressed
  files. (Bug found by Richard Clamp <richardc@tw2.com>
- Added #!/bin/sh as first line to make the rest compatible with csh/tcsh
  users. (Bug found by Ed Arnold <era@ucar.edu>)

New in version 3.9:
- Took out specialization engine because there wasn't enough support to
  program in that style.
- Offering 2 main versions now -- Date::Manip and Date::Parse
- Added -R option, which causes grepmail to recurse any directories
  encountered. (Thanks to Emil Tiller <etiller@asc.corp.mot.com> for the
  initial code.)

- Fixed bug in parsing timezones of emails. (Thanks to Wolfgang Weisselberg
  <weisselberg@element5.de>)
- Fixed bug in handling of date specifications like "2 days ago" and "2 weeks
  ago"
- Added -M switch, which causes grepmail to ignore non-text attachments.
- Added "quiet mode", -q switch, which supresses warnings about directories,
  non-mailbox ASCII files, binary files that can't be decompressed, etc.
- Restructured code a bit. Moved file and STDIN processing out of main. The
  whole email is now read before the match is made to the body, instead of
  trying to match the pattern while reading the body. (This simplifies the
  algorithms and makes -M support a lot easier, at the cost of increasing the
  required memory slightly.) Now uses ungetc to put the test characters used
  during file type detection back on the stream.

New in version 3.7:
- Added -D for debugging output
- Now ignores ASCII files that don't look like mailboxes. Thanks to oak
  <oak@eskimo.com> for pointing this out.
- Uses Date::Parse instead of Date::Manip, which results in faster execution
  time at the expense of less flexibility. (e.g. You can't do "12pm January 5
  1997" any more)

New in version 3.6:
- No more temporary files! This addresses the security issues that a few
  people have sent me email about. The script may use slightly more memory,
  depending on the size of the largest email. (Email is now buffered as it is
  read, and the whole buffer is printed when a match occurs. This is in
  contrast to storing the file pointer and seeking back to the start of the
  email.) The script is substantially faster for large amounts of data piped
  as STDIN. Many thanks go to Joey Hess (<joey@kitenet.net>), who supplied
  insights and contributions toward making this release happen, especially the
  buffering code.  

New in version 3.5:
- grepmail will not try to decompress piped input that is empty.
- Temporary files are now placed in the user's home directory to help avoid
  privacy attacks (or in the directory specified by the TMPDIR environment
  variable, if it exists).
- Fixed a bug that would occasionally leave a tempfile around.

New in version 3.4.1:
- Fixed a bug that added an extra line to the start of output. (Thanks to
  Moritz Barsnick <barsnick@gmx.net> for helping to find this.)

New in version 3.4:
- Added tzip support. (thanks to Marc Lehmann <pcg@goof.com>)
- Reordered flags to better match grep.
- Changed command line syntax again. (Last time, I hope.)

New in version 3.3:
- Added bzip2 support. (thanks to Josh Plautz <plautz@milner.com>).
- Improved error checking on piped binary input.
- Added debugging code.

New in version 3.2:
- Added TMPFILE environment variable support, and a signal handler. (thanks
  to Ulli Horlacher (<framstag@moep.bb.bawue.de>).
- Fixed a bug where the last paragraph of the last email in a mailbox would
  not be printed on Linux. (How's that for obscure? Thanks to Eli Criffield
  <rexracer@mammoth.org> for discovering it.)

New in version 3.1:
- Modified the decompression to be more compatible with older versions of gzip.
- Improved error checking so that "grepmail -h" prints a usage message.
- Added -m flag, which causes an "X-Mailfolder" line to be added to the
  header, thereby showing which folder contained the message. (by Ulli
  Horlacher <framstag@moep.bb.bawue.de>).
- Improved error checking on flags.
- Changed "zcat" to "gunzip -c" to help with backwards compatibility with older
  versions of gzip (thanks to Eugene Kim <eekim@eekim.com>).

New in version 3.0:
- -h and -b can be used together.
- Rewrote the ProcessMailFile to run 2 to 3 times faster, and use less memory.
- Correctly diagnoses directories as such (by Gerald Pfeifer
  <pfeifer@dbai.tuwien.ac.at>).

New in version 2.1:
- Added -l,-r, and -e, as suggested by Reinhard Max <max@suse.de>.
- Now uses about 1/3 the memory, and is a little faster.

New in version 2.0.1:
- Added POD documentation at the end of the script (thanks, Jeffrey
  Haemer <jsh@boulder.qms.com>).
- -h for headers only -b for body only

New in version 1.9:
- "Ignore empty files" by Gerald Pfeifer <pfeifer@dbai.tuwien.ac.at>.
- Emails without dates are now automatically output no matter what the
  date specification is. (Better safe than sorry!)

New in version 1.7:
- Sped up by Andrew Johnson. It no longer looks for dates unless the email
  matches the search string.

New in version 1.6:
- Removed use of Compress::Zlib because it was 30% slower, complicated the
  code, and because any user with gzip'd mail has zcat...

New in version 1.5:
- Andrew Johnson <ajohnson@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> fixed a couple of bugs.

New in version 1.4:
- Incorporated conditional loading of the date module (submitted by Andrew
  Johnson <ajohnson@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> Many thanks!).
- compress::Zlib used instead of shelling out to gunzip (submitted by Andrew
  Johnson <ajohnson@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca> Many thanks!).
- Some bug fixes (submitted by Andrew Johnson <ajohnson@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca>
  Many thanks!).
- Also restructured the code a bit.

New in version 1.3:
- Made it pipeable so you can do: grepmail <pattern> file | grepmail <pattern>

New in version 1.2:
- Restructured the code a bit.

New in version 1.1:
- Support for dates.

New in version 1.0:
- Initial version, with -v -i, and gzip support
