Subject: Re: Digital outputs.

Thanks David for a nice explanation of how to add I/O using shift 
registers.

Let us not all forget that the HB does have two uncommitted digital
output ASIDE from the four SPI pins:  PA7 (a bidirectional pin which
is marked as digital input #9) and PA5 (a timer output pin which is
marked as TO3 on the expansion header).

It would seem silly to disconnect a motor driver signal when these
two signals are available.

Fred
