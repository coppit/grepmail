  Check out this site.  It works well.  The only problem I had was timing
issues when trying to read and write to the port too quickly.

At long last, I dusted off Chuck McManis Handyboard library and ported it
to V5. No reason why it can't work with V4.5 either ;-) Anyway, to try it
out, point your browser to

ftp://ftp.imagecraft.com/pub/libhb.zip

Chuck really did a great job with the LCD. There are commands to scroll,
move etc. Make sure you try the lcdtest2.c test.
