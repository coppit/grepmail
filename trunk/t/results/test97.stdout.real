Hi -

I'm a handy-board/ic newbie, so please excuse this question if it's answers 
seem obvious.  After two weeks of writing code in DOS/Windows (yuck), I 
downloaded the ic-2.860beta source code, which compiled without significant 
trouble in linux (redhat 5).  The version is, of course, a bit different from 
that which came with the handy-board (from Gleason Rsch, was version 2.851).

My question is, can I just copy the library files that came from Gleason Rsch. 
into the lib directory on the unix ic installation (it seems that I can, I 
just want to be sure)?  Are there any other issues I should be aware of 
(w.r.t. the beta, or using ic from unix, end-of-line conventions on library 
files, etc.).  I'm not particularly concerned with being able to download the 
pcode in unix - I do have DOS easily available...

BTW, thanks to all that have contributed to this really neat project - this is 
my first exposure to robotics, and it's been great fun so far.

Thanks everyone for sourcing information on this device.  I've got several
in hand, feedback resistors are in the mail.  Now can I get existing
OPT1210 user experience re: the following questions:

1)  I assume (dangerous I know...) that the easiest circuit (per the
Burr-Brown App Notes) is the Fig. 3 "Single Power Supply Operation"?
2)  Is 12v operation recommended?
3)  If 12v operation, did you use a 5.6v zener or lower value?
4)  Did you use electrolytics to bypass to ground pins 1 & 8?
5)  Did you build this circuit in a shielded box?
6)  Does the on-board opamp provide sufficient output to drive a set of
headphones or did you add another opamp gain circuit?  If so what low noise
device?  Any highpass filter circuits?  Is there any need for a bandpass
filter circuit to get rid of audio highs?

I am using a 3" PVC with a focusing lens (f/4") - - how did you
mechanically place the OPT210 so the focused light source falls on the
photodiode?  My approach would be trial-versus-error....

Thanks in advance....Guy N7UN/2

Joshua -

There should be no problems using the Gleason Research libraries (or
any of the libraries that are on the web site).  There are no differences
between version 2.851 and 2.860 from the point of view of the
libraries.

There is a pre-compiled version for Linux.  See

ftp://cher.media.mit.edu/pub/projects/interactive-c/unix/
