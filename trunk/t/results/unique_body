Hello,	
	I've been having some problems using my HandyBoard to talk directly to my
PC via the serial interface.  I disable Interactive C and then Poke() and
Peek() as has been described on this list.  I  send short character strings
from my PC to the HandyBoard under Windows 95.  If I send strings longer
than 2 characters, it seems that some of the characters get lost. This
behavior seems to be affected by repositioning or slightly modifying the
code, suggesting perhaps a timing issue.
 
Why might this be?  Is there any way to check for an error situation?

Thanks for any help,
		Aaron

Get a copy of icc11 v5.0 or later (from www.imagecraft.com) and use the
handyboard library from their site.

Hi

I suggest that you contact ImageCraft.
http://www.imagecraft.com/software/index.html  or  info@imagecraft.com 

They have a C compiler for 68HC11 CPU's that will do what you want, including a
library for the HandyBoard (see attached e-mail) !

I have no affiliation with ImageCraft (other than as a satisfied customer).

Hope this helps
Scott

At long last, I dusted off Chuck McManis Handyboard library and ported it
to V5. No reason why it can't work with V4.5 either ;-) Anyway, to try it
out, point your browser to

ftp://ftp.imagecraft.com/pub/libhb.zip

Chuck really did a great job with the LCD. There are commands to scroll,
move etc. Make sure you try the lcdtest2.c test.
