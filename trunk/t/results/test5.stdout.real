Hello,	
	I've been having some problems using my HandyBoard to talk directly to my
PC via the serial interface.  I disable Interactive C and then Poke() and
Peek() as has been described on this list.  I  send short character strings
from my PC to the HandyBoard under Windows 95.  If I send strings longer
than 2 characters, it seems that some of the characters get lost. This
behavior seems to be affected by repositioning or slightly modifying the
code, suggesting perhaps a timing issue.
 
Why might this be?  Is there any way to check for an error situation?

Thanks for any help,
		Aaron

Yes,
        Write a dos/windows client that reads the serial line and then
writes it to file using the C stdio library.

  Check out this site.  It works well.  The only problem I had was timing
issues when trying to read and write to the port too quickly.
