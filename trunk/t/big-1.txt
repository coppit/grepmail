yet ANOTHER idea, if you are suitably masochistic, is to use the SPI port
for a much more extensible I/O system.  As you know, SPI uses 4 basic
control signals, MOSI, MISO, CLK and SS... Ok, what we used to do in
Embedded Controllers class is hook up a Serial In/Parallel Out
(hereforward referred to as a SIPO) shift register.  You must have at
least ONE output available, so, this pretty much eliminates a L293 or, if
you are bold enough, obtain additional outputs using a '138 as outlined in
the HandyBoard FAQ.  A SIPO you might use is the 8 bit 74164.

Hook the DATA IN on the SIPO to the MOSI pin on the SPI.  Hook the
SPI's CLK output to the SIPO's clock pin.  Use a transparent latch to
update and hold the data on the outputs of the SIPO and update it with the
one output pin, perhaps a 74373.

To update the new 8 bits of data appearing at your latch's output, you load 
the SPI's data register with the byte value that you want to have across
your new outputs.  This data will be shifted out during the next 8 E-clock
cycles.  After the SPI's data register is empty indicating that the SIPO
has the output byte on it's parallel outputs, pulse the single control
output to update the latch's outputs.

With this arrangement, you could, in theory, have many, many SIPO shift
register/Latch pairs;  the Serial Data In of the next stage connected to
the last Parallel Output on the previous adjacent stage.

One would just have to make sure that you coordinated the number of stages
with the number of bytes outshifted by the SPI data register (naturally).
The downside to this arrangement is the time it takes to update a digital
output.  The entire train (8 bits, 16 bits, 24 bits... more?) Need to be
loaded and shifted out to change just ONE output.  The upside is, the data
will shift at 2 Mhz, which makes for a (250 ns * [8+2] ) 2.5 ms update
time.  Not suitable for time critical applications, (PWM, Communication)
but not bad for bulk outputs.

I don't think I have explained my little circuit here very well.. perhaps
an ASCII graphic?

Thanks David for a nice explanation of how to add I/O using shift 
registers.

Let us not all forget that the HB does have two uncommitted digital
output ASIDE from the four SPI pins:  PA7 (a bidirectional pin which
is marked as digital input #9) and PA5 (a timer output pin which is
marked as TO3 on the expansion header).

It would seem silly to disconnect a motor driver signal when these
two signals are available.

Here is an Interactive C file to do just that. Seems to work well in the
10 minues of testing I've just done. :) Let me know if anyone has problems
with this:

/* First you must DisableSPI(), then you can   */
/* WritePortD(). If you need to use SPI again, */
/* use EnableSPI(). To read from port D, use   */

#define D_ALL_OUT 0b00111100
#define D_ALL_IN  0b00000000

/* Set bits in dir to set direction of I/O on port D           */
/* A 1 in bits 5 through 2 will enable that bit in             */
/* port D as output. Others will be inputs. Does not           */
/* affect bits 0 and 1 (TxD and RxD)                           */
/* Use

void DisableSPI(int dir) {
    int x;
    bit_clear(0x1028, 0b01000000);
    x = peek(0x1009);
    x = (x & 0b00000011) | (dir & 0b00111100);
    poke(0x1009, x);
}

void EnableSPI(void) {
    int x;
    x = peek(0x1009);
    x = (x & 0b00000011);
    poke(0x1009, x);
}

void WritePortD(int val) {
    int x;
    x = peek(0x1008);
    x = (x & 0b00000011) | (val & 0b00111100);
    poke(0x1008, x);
}

int ReadPortD(void) {
    return(peek(0x1008) & 0b00111100);
}

If you're just interested in sample code, check out:

ftp://ftp.cmf.nrl.navy.mil/pub/kenh/minilib.tar.gz

Code to talk the Dallas One-Wire protocol is included.  Also included
is sample C code that implements the bus discovery protocol.

It's actually pretty easy to do the protocol.  The timing requirements
are fairly lax; you have to add some NOPs even with a 2MHz HC11 to get
the right delay.  The data sheets include the complete protocol.

This isn't really a question about the Handyboard, but I thought that this
would be the best place to ask.

I have many motors that came with my Handyboard kit (from Gleason
Research), but I want to use them with the Lego kits. Is there an easy way
to convert these motors to ones with Lego casings, etc?

Thanks for any pointers,

Subject: Any used Handyboards available or PC boards?

Hi,

Is there anyone out there have any handyboards they no longer want or does
anyone have some Handyboard
PC boards that they want to offload?
Or
Are their any folks in the Vancouver area want to buy a number of blanks
boards as an aggregrate to reduce
the cost per board? 

Let me know.

tnx

There were a couple atricles in Circuit Cellar Ink over the years
on RS-485 using the 75176 chip.  Their home control system uses it for
the various IO devices.

The National semiconductor web site has a couple app notes for using
the chip, including "10 Ways To Bulletproof RS-485 Interfaces".

I use the Freeware IC compiler. 
I find that every 3-4 attempts of starting IC or loading a file causes
my PC to either hang or crash with garbage on the screen. After a reboot
everything is fine for another 3-4 times! In between the problems
everything works fine.

Any ideas as to the problem?

  You could use spezial interface chips to solve your problem. Hewlett
Packard has some chips (HCTL2016, HCTL2020) which are easy to use and offer
a lot of features.

I have used the HCTL2020 with the handyboard. If you want to interface the
shaft encoder without special chip you need to measure the pulsewidth of
the signal from the encoder aswell as a direction bit which you can
generate with a simple and-gate. I have written a couple of programs (asm)
to measure frequencies and pulsewidth with the Input Counter of the hc11.
Tell if you need them.

Hi -

I'm a handy-board/ic newbie, so please excuse this question if it's answers 
seem obvious.  After two weeks of writing code in DOS/Windows (yuck), I 
downloaded the ic-2.860beta source code, which compiled without significant 
trouble in linux (redhat 5).  The version is, of course, a bit different from 
that which came with the handy-board (from Gleason Rsch, was version 2.851).

My question is, can I just copy the library files that came from Gleason Rsch. 
into the lib directory on the unix ic installation (it seems that I can, I 
just want to be sure)?  Are there any other issues I should be aware of 
(w.r.t. the beta, or using ic from unix, end-of-line conventions on library 
files, etc.).  I'm not particularly concerned with being able to download the 
pcode in unix - I do have DOS easily available...

BTW, thanks to all that have contributed to this really neat project - this is 
my first exposure to robotics, and it's been great fun so far.

Joshua -

There should be no problems using the Gleason Research libraries (or
any of the libraries that are on the web site).  There are no differences
between version 2.851 and 2.860 from the point of view of the
libraries.

There is a pre-compiled version for Linux.  See

ftp://cher.media.mit.edu/pub/projects/interactive-c/unix/

Hello,
I've bought a handy board, and try to build a card to enserve two motors.
On that card I have a IC chip (HP hctl 1100) that needs to be link to a 8 bits
Adress/data bus in both reading and writing modes. My problem is where to pick
such a bus on the board. So my two questions are:
- Is it possible to connect to D0..D7 bus (knowing I want to keep the screen 
   working as it's made for) to pick up informations without affecting the
screen
   functions? In that case do I need something as a latch to differentiate the
way 
   for the informations to go?
- Otherwise, how could I pick 8 I/O port on the board?

Please, help me: It makes me stay awaken all nights!!
Thanks in advance.

I am building a somewhat similar circuit (a high-current h-bridge for
the handy board), although I only need to read the data lines.  However,
the same approach will work for writing to the bus.  My circuit lives on
a board which plugs in between the LCD and the main board.  That is, it
has two male header strips on the bottom to plug into the CPU board, and
it has one female header strip on top to accomodate the LCD board.  I
have wired the pins on the leftmost header straight through so that the
LCD can work as before.  For reading the data bus, I have also attached
the D0-D7 lines to a 74HC374.  The Y4 line controls the clock to this
chip, which lets me write a word to the chip by writing to address
0x6000.  For writing to the HB bus, you can hang a 74HC244 on the data
lines, and run the Y5 line to the /G pins (pin numbers 1 and 19).  That
will allow you to read a word from that chip by reading from 0x6000. 
For examples, look at the schematics for the Handy Board's motor driver
and digital input circuits; they work the same way, using lines Y6 and
Y7, respectively.

Fred did a good job designing the Handy Board to be expandable; these
changes are relatively simple, and give you a lot of flexibility.  I
can't wait to finish by own circuit and try it out.

Good luck,

Please read Appendix B of the 6.270 Robot Builders Guide.  This
explains how to interface latches with the Handy Board.

Subject: using handyboard with vernier ULI
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello from New Mexico
I'm currently teaching a robotics class at the high school level and we
have been exploring the possibility of creating a rover that will
eventually be independent and have enough AI to make decisions that will
get it through the halls of the school, eventually getting to our front
door. This is all on one level and an occasional slight ramp.
So far we have programmed in C++ and with a laptop and the Vernier ULI
interface attached to a laptop, we communicate using a motion
detectorand the computer sends a message to the screen to go a certain
direction (north,east,south ,west) but the person has to do the moving
of the cart.  The Handyboard seemed like a perfect item to take the
place of the laptop. It should do the job of moving around in the halls.
So far my students have succeeded in getting the handyboard to turn on
the motors and respond to small bits of IC code.  We have C++ code in
the laptop and assembly code to communicate with the ULI from the
laptop, and wonder what adjustments we will have to make to create an
independent rover that just uses the handyboard and ULI to do the trick.
thanks for any input you can share.

Hello Out there!

We are a group of computer science students here in Universidad Simon 
Bolivar (Caracas, Venezuela). We are currently teaching a robotics 
course as we took it last trimester. We are having trouble initializing 
the handyboards. The IC software doesn't seem to recognize them, and 
when it does it prompts some errors like 99, 101 etc. We are trying to 
get the Pcode downloaded but nothing seems to  work right.  I'm open to 
as many answers as you can send me. It's very important, because we have 
to keep the course advancing.

Thank to all of you.

I downloaded the 9600 baud serial driver that uses Digital input #9 or
PA7 (I think).

It is really unclear to me which connector I should plug into. In
between the IR I/O section and the BATTPWR LED's there are a bunch of
connectors. The manual seems to say that J2 is what I need and also
talks about a connector labeled (right to left) 7-15.

I don't have any way of testing this and I was wondering if anyone knew
which connector to use.

have build it as far as the power supply, stop switch and 68hc11 installed,
memory and 
lcd. When I try to send pcode_hb.s19 it sometimes stops half way through
and says
"error loading byte #0x98" and sometimes #0x99, #0x9a. And when it does
load it all it comes up with "invalid CONFIG Register (0x0d) try again"
although it is set to 0x0c in the box in HBDL . I have downloaded the pcode
file again from the handy board site to see if it was the file but when I
downloaded it to the board I still had no luck.

Thanks,
Gysmo@es.co.nz

I had the same problem. I was never able to get HBDL to set the config
register. I used DL to set it on one board and DLM on another. I used the
information from the HandyBoard technical reference manual to use these
programs.

http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/Projects/handyboard/techdocs/hbmanual
.pdf

Once the config register was set I was then able to use HBDL. I hope this
helps. Please remember if you use DL or DLM on a Win95 machine, run them in
full screen mode. Neither program will behave correctly if you run them in
a does window. They will appear to work correctly, but you will error
communicating with the board.

Hi there,

Would these chips be suitable for interfacing a mouse to
the Handyboard? My robot incorporates a mouse as a
castor wheel and I want to use its shaft encoders as
position/velocity sensors (relative) for the robot, but
I don't know where to look for details on how the
signals are generated and transmitted for a mouse. Do
you have any suggestions?

Marie

Hi there,

O.K, , I still have a question. I'm working with a handy board and it
use a special mode to talk to a LCD. If i understand , the handy board
need to put the reset vector in the range BFC0 - BFFF. If get the
aplication note for the 711E9 and ,as it say, if i want to use the 12
K OTPROM i need to put the reset vector in the FFC0-FFFF range . I
want to use that that
chip to remove the battery and use that beatifoul option of ROM.
I want to make my code run from my OPTROM and use RAM extern from
8000-AFFF . The aplicattion note say the OPTROM will be  allocatted at
C000-FFFF. My problem actually is to know if i have some possible
solution for the reset vetor location : i really can't believe that
question be a problem . Any help can be great. Thanks in advance.

hello,
I tryed to download the pcode_hb.s19 file using DL, When it starts sending
it stops and says "expected 244, received 150, after 144 chars recieved"
I cant seem to get any of the downloaders to work. Im a bit stuck on where
the problems lies as i have traced the bus systems through with a meter and
cheaked for shorts, dry joints etc.
also i was wondering if i had the wrong ram as it has 62256-10 on it and
the mannel says 62256-100, are these the same or is this the problem.

thanks,

Well, finally i see the option of 711e9 is not god, i see the K9
version have 24 K optrom and the vector location is inside my optrom.
That's god , because i need to start in special test mode. But , a

Hello,

I'm trying to outfit a Motorola 68HC12 evaluation board as a handyboard
robot controller. Since Randy Sargeant's Handyboards' use the 68H11
(which is source-code compatible with the 'H12), I'd like to share
information with people who've done the conversion or are planning to.

Of course, any sort of advice (on the foolhardiness of this undertaking,
etc.) is more than welcome. :)
 
(Why did I buy the 'H12 board in the first place? -- Well, Motorola's  
selling it cheap for their design contest.  See
http://mot-sps.com/contest/ for details)

Regards,
- Sonam Chauhan

German --

The Dallas NV RAM should work fine.

Just so you know -- for future reference -- Interactive C will not
work resident in a ROM.  Interactive C must operate out of RAM.

Hi all,

Those of you running Internet Explorer on Windows 95 or NT have
probably noticed that the table of links running down the left column
is hard to read -- light blue (or purple) links on a medium blue
background.

Those links are supposed to be white, but for some reason MS in its
infinite wisdom decided that the FONT COLOR= tag can not override link
colorization.  Never mind that IE on the Mac and Netscape allow
coloring of individual text links.

One solution is to colorize all the text links on a page, but I don't
like that answer.

So I'm field-testing graphical buttons for the left-column
navigation.  This is still a frames-less approach which should make
navigation simple and clear.

I've installed the proposed design in the Software area of the web
site.  I'd appreciate any feedback about the design, especially from
users who have noticed poor link visibility.  Just go to:

  <http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/>

and let me know how it looks.  Thanks.

Fred

In the Handyboard homepage under 6500 polaroid sonar libraries, there is a
great illustration (BRAVO!) that depicts the connections from the HB to
the module that operates the sonar itself.  The power supply to the module
(which should be around +5V) is connected via the motor power supply
hookup with 6 diodes in series to reduce the 9V to the required range.

My question is: can I use any +5V / ground connection on the HB
instead of the motor power supply  (Our supply is an external one and
uses almost 30V and rather than connecting 30-some diodes in series... you
get the point) ???

Also, Can I use D2 and D3 to control a second sonar module without too
many changes?

Thank you,

Yoni Garbourg

Hello everyone,

This year's MIT LEGO Robot Design Competition will be on Wednesday,
January 28, 1998, in MIT room 26-100.  All are welcome to attend this
free event, and kids are especially encouraged to come!

Please see the URL

<http://whereis.mit.edu/bin/map?locate=none&locate=none&locate=none&locate=none&locate=none&locate=room_26-100&locate=none&locate=none&locate=none&locate=none&locate=none&locate=none&locate=none&locate=none>

for a map of MIT buildings showing building 26, room 100.

  (If that URL doesn't work, start at
  <http://whereis.mit.edu/doc/locate.html>, find the "Classrooms"
  pick-list, choose "26-100," and then click on the adjacent "Locate"
  button.)

The easiest way to find 26-100, if you're not familiar with the MIT
campus, is to begin at the grand entrance of the 77 Massachusetts
Avenue dome, and walk straight in, through buildings 7, 3, 10, 4, and
8 (the "Infinite Corridor").  When building 8 ends, you can go
outside, turn left, or turn right.  Take the left, walking down a set
of stairs and into building 16 and then into building 26.  26-100 is a
big lecture hall with doors on the right, which is the only room on
the ground floor of building 26.

The official start time of the contest is 6:00 pm, but YOU MUST ARRIVE
BETWEEN 4:30 AND 5:00 PM IF YOU WANT TO SIT.  Street parking should be
available at that hour on Mass Ave, Memorial Drive, or any of the
neighboring side streets.

If you're making a family outing of it, my advice is to show up no
later than 4:30, drop the advance party off at the Mass Ave entrance
to get in and hold seats, and then have the remaining party park the
car and show up with pizza and soda.  (A good local pizza joint is
Hi-Fi Pizza, 617/492-4600, located about 6 blocks up on the left at
496 Mass Ave.)


Hope to see you there!

Fred

I haven't seen the schematic you're refering to but I believe you can use
the +5V bus already on a standard HB. Just connect your PWR/GND to one of
those headers "below" one of the A/D inputs. I did this before and it
worked. Apparrently, the 1A +5V regulator can handle the 2A surges the
sensor loads.

Hi, I trying to make a home page about interfacing handy board with
stepper motors, I hope it has enought quality to add a little contibution
to the handyboard effort.

 For now I has just two part :

	One is just mails I found in the mail archive about stepper motors
	http://laguna.fmedic.unam.mx/~daniel/handy_mail.html
	I will soon update the " Interesting mail list ", it has just one
	mail for now. But you can seach in the file of e-mails that have
	the stepper word in them.

	The second part is just how to get a bipolar motor going with a
	handy-board.
	http://laguna.fmedic.unam.mx/~daniel/handy_bipolar.html
	
	TO DO:

	Write a real program that doesn't use the PMW functions fd() and
	bk (), and poke's to the right ports.
	Make a page for the unipolar stepper motor.
	Find some cookbook diver circuts to attach to the handy-board
	digital outputs.
	Make or buy an expansion board to test it with stepper motors.

All you suggestions and constuctive critics are wellcome.

	We seem to have a problem and we're not sure how it came about, 
and even less sure about how to fix it.
	We were using our board to drive our robot.  At this point we had 
a simple program, both motors on full forever.  We turned the board on, 
the Display went completely black, then started clearing from left to 
right.  We turned off the board, turned it back on, and the same symptoms 
occured.  It only cleared to about the half way point.  We assumed the 
battery was dead, so we let it charge over night.  This morning we turned 
on the board, the LCD was completely blank.   We downloaded pcode_hb.s19 
successfully according to the downloader.  We turn on the board, the LCD 
is still blank, the green power LED is lit, and the board will not 
respond when we attempt to run interactive'c'. 
	We are pretty much at a loss right now.  Any help/advise you can 
give would be greatly appreciated.
					Thank You

I haven't tried this on the HB; but I have with other processors.  I had
problems with the sonar ping resetting the processor at times, as well as
digital noise on the power supply bus causing false echo returns at long
distances (as the polaroid sonar module waits for an echo it turns up it's
sensitivity to the echo signal, as well as it's sensitivity to digital noise).

What I found to work well for me was to put a "filter/energy storage bank" at
each sonar module.  This consisted of a series inductor feeding a large, low
esr, filter cap.  The inductor was a 100uH, 2A "RF choke", and the cap was a
2,200uF, 16V and of good quality.  The inductor you can find almost anywhere,
Radio Shack, Mouser, etc.  For the cap I suggest a good quality one (not the
kind you find at Radio Shack), like a Panasonic from Digi-Key.

Using this method I was able to power a processor and three polaroid sonar
modules all from the same 5V supply.

But obviously if it works ok with just hooking it up you don't need to go to all
this trouble.  I just wanted to point out some potential problems to keep an eye
out for.

	The problem was isolated to a bad LCD display.  This was 
accomplished by using the pcode file contributed by Kent (which doesn't 
require the display to be present while the board is on.) Special thanks 
to Gleason Research for finding/isolating this problem.

Hello everyone,

From my mail yesterday:
> I'm trying to outfit a Motorola 68HC12 evaluation board as a handyboard
> robot controller. Since ***Randy Sargeant's Handyboards'*** use the 68H11

This is a quick note of apology for referring to the Handyboard as
"Randy Sargeant's Handyboard" (thus unintentionally downplaying Fred
Martin's contribution.) It was particularly inappropriate in this
mailing list to which Fred selflessly devotes so much time and effort.

Best regards,
- Sonam Chauhan

PS: I'd be grateful for any inputs on my earlier mail -- about wiring up
a Motorola HC12 Eval kit as a Handyboard.

Hi

I've ported the changes (Julian Skidmore's mod) to the IC 3.1 pcode source code: 
(available from ftp://newtonlabs.com/pub/pcode/pcode31.exe)

But I don't have anywhere outside a corporate firewall to put the files (a new
pcode_hb.s19 and a modified lib_hb.c file - 27k in all) !

I'm also concerned about putting modified copyrighted files on the net, without
getting permission from the copyright owner....

I've cc'd this message to Randy Sargent of Newtonlabs - If Randy says it's OK
then I'll forward the files to Fred for inclusion on the HandyBoard WWW site.

Scott

	Where may I purchase the HP expansion board (built & tested)?
If that is not available, where may I find the source code for the PIC

	My old univ. robot team (most are still in school in one

interested.

Thank you.

Scott,

Thanks for incorporating Julian's changes into the 3.1 pcode.

In fact, if we can have Julian's permission and yours as well, Scott, we'd
be very interested to be able to redistribute the improved pcode with IC
3.1.

Scott and Julian, would this be OK?  If so, please contact me and I'll set
up for you to FTP the file here.

Thanks!

-- Randy

i have teh sensor hooked up, and I didn't test it much yet, but so far, I
am getting a clicking sound when I run it, but the values appear to be
completely random (a lot even negative).  Am I doing something
wrong that's obvious.

Hi

I don't have any objection to putting the modified files up for general
download - I only added Julian's code to the 3.1 source...

I also modified the "boot" message so that it is obvious that you are running
the new PWM code. I've changed the IC version definition to print:
"IC 3.1 SMOOTHPWM"

If you like I can send the modified pcode.asm and Makefile to Newtonlabs for
inclusion in the next version of IC (or diff's if you would prefer).

I've tested the new s19 file and can't find any anomalies, and the change in
motor control really does work (thanks Julian !).

First of all, is it even possible to use an E2 68HC11 variant w/ the HB? =
 And if so can I d/l to it without having the LCD attached?  As it =
stands now, I receive an error that the board is in the wrong mode using =
HBDL.exe while trying to d/l the pcode_hb.s19.  Any ideas?

Hello,

Can anyone suggest a graceful means of printing a floating point number to the LCD using a specified number of decimal places?

Thanks,

I once heard of a competition where the objective

Does anyone know of links to information on this

Hello!

Does anyone have some simple assembler programs that can be used to test
the operation of the handyboard?  For example, an assembler program that
beeps the piezzo "speaker", or one that blinks some of the LEDs. 
Anything would be most helpful at this point.

Thank you.

Try this url for a test program.

I have not tried the program myself, so I can't tell you anything about it.

Does anyone have a good source for getting the E2 chip and other parts that
are used to build the handyboard and miniboard. In my search for a good
price on the E2 I found that Newark has the chip for $27.00. Newark also
has many of the other parts like the TI motor chips. I have found the
Arrrow has the E2 for $7.84. Arrow also sells the TI chip and the L293D.
The problem with them was they a  $25 minimum per line item. Arrow has just
about everything that I had a hard time finding except for the ds1233-10.

Thanks

may show that I'm a neophyte as a hardware hacker, but I could
use some help.

In the HandyBoard FAQ under the question: "Does the Handy Board
have any digital outputs?", the following instructions are included:

* d0..d7 is the data bus and stuff is flying around on those pins all
the time,
* so they cannot be used as outputs. If you hook an =92hc374 chip to the
board,
* in the same fashion as the one driving the motor chips, you get 8 more
digital
* outs. Connect the =92hc374=92s clock line to any of the three unused
output  latch
* selects of the =92hc138 (Y0, Y2,or Y4). All of these signals are presen=
t
on the
* Expansion Bus.

Has anyone done this?  Does this mean that, to get the additional 8
digital outs,
an 'hc374 should be connected as follows:

1. Pins 1D through 8D of 'hc374 connected to the HandyBoard's D0 through
D7?
2. Pins 1Q through 8Q are now the digital outs?

Is it really this simple?  Should resistors or diodes be added to the
circuit?  How
are the new outputs selected?

If this is off-base, can someone expand on the instructions in the FAQ?

I'd appreciate any assistance offered.

Stephen

Hello all,

I would like to be able to 'drive' my robot using the Handy Board via a radio 
link. For this purpose I have bought two transceivers, the Radiometrix BiM 418 
F.

How can I connect it to my Handy Board? The wiring is as follows (leaving out 
+5V and Ground):


Aerial
|
|     ________ Tx select
|    |
_____/|_______ Tx data
  |  \|
  |
  |    _______ Rx select
  |   |
  |__|\_______ Rx data
     |/
      |_______ Carrier detect


Which pins of the RJ11 connector, digital inputs and SPI do I need for this?

I'm not very good at electronics, so any help would be very much appreciated. 
Thanks in advance.

Greetings,
Jan Sipke van der Veen

Then if Y0, Y2, and Y4 were all used for this purpose, I assume
24 digital outputs could be realized?  Cool.

Thanks for the response, I'll give it a try.

Hi Fred

There was a short article on the news last night about a new Lego robotics
product that looked alot like the "lego intelligent brick" concept you were
working on last year...

A bit of searching revealed the site http://www.legomindstorms.com/ which
mentions the MIT Media Lab.

Is this the project that grew out of the HandyBoard (or was it the other way
around) ?

Scott

    I have been thinking of getting a pair of those babies. How much did they cost
you?

Hi Scott (& everyone),

Yes, two days ago the LEGO company officially launched "LEGO
Mindstorms," which is a new brand and product line inspired by the MIT
Programmable Brick research.

Scott -- thanks for noticing, and digging up the URL
<http://www.legomindstorms.com/>.

I am very excited about LEGO's deep commitment to the educational and
entertainment value of kids building their own robots.  The LEGO
Mindstorms brand, and its flagship "RCX" programmable brick, is a
breakthrough in bringing these ideas into the home.

Fred

I'm no authority, but you might get away with a 3 amp fuse in a pinch.
However, the Polyswitch fuse is actually a PTC Thermistor designed to work
as a sort of solid state circuit breaker.  These have a variety of names;
look for "PTC fuse", "PTC current limiter", PTC resettable", or the like,
listed either under "fuse" or "thermistor".  You need one which will carry a
current of 2.5 amps, but will shut off at a maximum of 5 amps, with a 0.2
inch lead spacing.

I know of no reason why you cannot substitute for the ZTX614.

LittleFuse makes an identical replacement for the PolyFuse one.  Don't =

A lot of you guys (and girls) send-in nice ASCII schematics. The point is,
they look really messed up in MSIE4.0's OutLook, since I find type-fonts
like the good-old Courier, only 'Courier new', which is no good either. Does
anybody now a solution to this problem (like how to get OutLook to view
non-TrueType fonts) other than saving the file and open it in a program
which does support Courier?

	Hi,

	Try choosing a proportional font for displaying the
	messages (like 'system', or 'courier' or 'sans serif').
	I don't use MSIE4 Outlook, this info is based on experience
	with the same problem using Netscape Messager.
	Hope it helps.

Does anyone have a good source and hardware modification to do that ?

Thanks a lot.

Hello
I have a Fast Traxx car made by Metro wich I would like to run using my
Handy Board
and I was wondering what was the best way to run the motors either piggy
backing the L293s or some how interfacing into the existing motor control
circuit on the car.
Has anyone done this before? The motors draw up to 6-8 amps when stalled!

Cheers,

I recently attempted a download of code from IC-3.1 to a Handy Board,
including some large arrays and other global variables. I then got
an error message that there was an apparent conflict because I
had used too much space. While I cleaned things up, I am interested
in knowing if there is anything written down about space utilization
and management within the HB or by IC. I also am a bit perplexed by
almost 8Kbytes of "interrupts" loaded by IC???? That's a lot of
"interrupts!"			Dave Thompson

My handyboard works great,with a 68HC11A1 mcu.
    The config of the 103f register was done in one try and had no problems.
I then installed a 68HC811E2 MCU, (a 2k EEPROM version of the original).
Using DLM, HBDL and PCbug to try set the config register to 0C had no effect
on the register. This is what the programs show for that part of the MCU's
memory.

.....................................___________________________
Download successful
Config is 0xFF

Board's config register is incorrect.
Initializing config register to 0x0C.
You will now need to place your board in download mode again.

upon reset the config is still 0xFF.

     +0 +1 +2 +3 +4 +5 +6 +7 +8 +9 +A +B +C +D +E +F
103F FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF ...............

this one is using PCbug.

This is a factory fresh MCU, (I have a box of them this is why I would
really like to use them) any information on this problem and how to
correctly set the config register would really be of help.

Thanks,
 Quinn Marshal

Subject: Connecting a second sonar module

I'm curious about connecting two of the Polaroid sonar modules to the Handy
Board v1.2.  Does anyone know whether ports PD2, PD3 and TIC2 can be used to
hook up the second unit in the same way that PD4, PD5 and TIC3 are used for
one unit?  Or is there a better way to do it that wouldn't use up so many of
the ports (e.g., both modules sharing the same BINH and/or ECHO signals)?

Thanks (and apologies if this is a rehash--I had trouble downloading the
whole 4MB mailing list archive!).

used a phone cable and hooked it up to digital port 9, and then to the HB

I get nothing....  Any ideas?

Then it stops at this point everytime, I am using Dos 6.22 w/o windows 95,

only thing different is when I check the register for the other A1 after
setting the reg to something like 0D, the rest of the register has other
data in it. The 811e2 when checked shows only 0xFF all the why through the
whole register??

I ordered these from Motorola, and they should be good, I got a box.
Does anyone know what the default reg for the e2 is?

Thanks again,

We are using the handyboard to control our mobile robot and wish to install
the Skidmore smooth PWM routines as provided on the Handyboard web site.  We
are using Dunfield micro-C compiler version 3.1 in Windows95 along with the
handyboard library routines.

Perhaps it is trivial, but exactly how does one incorporate these routines
into our software? Any help or advise would be much appreciated.

Perhaps you have the RJ11 cable wired wrong.  Make sure you have the
ground signal  and the data from pa7/digital 9 connected.

see below...

Looking at the digital and analog sensor headers:

live signal [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]    [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]

+5v         [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]    [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
ground      [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]    [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]

sensor#      15  14  13  12  11  10  9   8   7      6   5   4   3   2   1


The whole row labeled "+5v" is a source of +5v power.  The whole row
labeled "ground" is a source of ground.  The row labeled "live signal"
is 15 different signal pins.

To attach to the 9600 baud output, you must connect from the live
signal line of sensor 9, and any ground.  You might as well use the
ground beneath the sensor 9 signal.  It would connect to an RJ11 plug
(to go into the HB serial interface) as follows:


                                         RJ11 plug
                                      (metal side up)

Sure, there's no reason you could set it up to use PD4, PD5, and
TIC3 for a 2nd sonar.

you might be able to get away with some signal multiplexing, assuming
you're only firing one sonar at a time.  i could see the BINH being no
problem.  For sharing the ECHO, make sure the polaroid outputs are
open collector so there isn't signal contention.

Synchronizing with board
Pcode version 10.81 present on board
Incompatible pcode version, or pcode corrupt
Please use "dl" to reload pcode.

Does this rings any bells, I don't have any clue?

If tried this several times on a 486 and a Pentium running standalone dos 7 
and a dos session under windows95 with the same result.

BTW if I download the PCODER22.S19 it is possible to start IC, perhaps this 
give somebody a hint.

Thanks for any help.

Maarten --

Quickly I can make the guess that your local copy of PCODE_HB.S19 is
corrupt.  The fact that PCODER22.S19 works indicates there's nothing
wrong with your board.

Try re-downloading PCODE_HB.S19 from the web site?

The encoder function pages say that for the fast encoder, the refresh rate
is only 1 KHz.  That is it can make only 1000 increments in a second.  If
I have an encoder that has a change rate on the order of a micro second,
is there any reasonable way to use the encoder routines with it, or is
there anything else I could do to use the  8 MHz (I think) clock of the
6811 for this particular encoding procedure.

Fred;

I am at the testanalogs portion of the assembly process.  All has gone
well up until this point.    The knob varies between 0 and 255 as
expected and the seven numbers all come up either 254 or 255 when I
press the START button.  However I am confused as to which headers I
should insert the 10k resistor as well as the output I receive depending
on which header pairs I use.  Are the two outer most headers the two
that are side by side at the edge of the board?  If I insert the
resistor in these the readings all stay 254 or 255.  Or are the two
outermost headers those which are separated by the in line resistor and
the other header, (i.e. the header closest to the edge and the header
closest to the plcc socket)?  When I insert the resistor in these
headers the number changes to 5 or 6 not 45.  The voltage at pins 51 and
52 check out and I seem to have continuity.

By the way, I attempted to download Pcode using hbdl and dlm using a 233
Pentium II, a 166 Pentium, and a 386 all without success.  However, I
was successful on the first try on the Pentium II using dl in a DOS
window.  Perhaps this should be recommended as the default down loader
for PC's.

Love your board;)

It is straight-thru.

Please note that if you are connecting from a 9-pin male PC port to
the HB interface's 25-pin female, the means that you have the
following mapping:

DB-9	DB-25
2	3
3	2
5	7

In other words, the same cable as you would use to connect to a
standard 25-pin female modem.

Hi all

I have written some routines to measure frequencies from 30Hz to 30kHz.
I'm posting this with an attachement because several people have ask me
already for these routines.

To Fred:
You can add these routines to the ftp server or anywhere on the handyboard hp
if you want.

  Description:

Here are my routines zipped for DOS.
The asm-files were written on a mac using an editor with tabs of 4 spaces and
saved
in DOS format. If you load these files
into an editor on the PC
you might get wrong tabs. With WinEdit on PC you can set the spacing to 4 and
everything works just fine.

I do not have any manual in english because so far everything is written in
german,
sorry :(((

But I can give you some instructions on how to use the programs.
There are two icb-files to measure a pulsewidth with the TIC ports 2 & 3.
--> pw_tic2.icb   /  -.asm
--> pw_tic3.icb   /  -.asm

Each of them has two global variables (pulsewidth2, pulse_done2 for TIC2, or
pulsewidth3, pulse_done for TIC3).
In the example below you can see how to use the routines:

while(1){
    get_pulsewidth3(0);
    while(! pulse_done3) {
        defer();
    }
    fehler = korrektur + pulsewidth3-servo7_pulse_length/2;
}

After calling get_pulsewidth3(0) the asm-routine triggers and measures ONE
pulse
one TIC3. The argument has no effects
on the routine. The pulsewidth can vary from about 35 microsecs up to 32ms. If

shorter the routine will overread the pulse, if

longer the internel counter will overflow and give you a false reading.
With the global variable pulse_done3 you can find out wether the measuring has

finished or not as shown above.
Now you can read the pulsewidth with the global variable pulsewidth3.
Be careful measuring pulsewidth smaler than 100us because the proportional
error
rises.

To measure a wavelength with the supplied program (wl.icb /-.asm) you need to
call
the asm-routine get_wavelength(0).
After that you can trigger the end of a measurement with the global variable
wavelength. As long as this variable is equal to
0 nothing has been measured. As soon as it reads anything else than 0 that
value is
the measured wavelength. You can
measure wavelength from about 35 microsecs up to 32ms. Same problems as above
with
the proportional error.
There is only one routine for the TIC3 sofar, but it is really easy to change
the
routine to use it with any other Timer Input
Counter.

So, that's it.....

Hope you can use these routines.

Tom

Subject: Eprom Programmer info

Hi all,
I have acquired an old Bytek Eprom/Pal programmer, Model S10 with and epm2
adapter. 
I have no manual.

Does anyone out there have one, who might be able to photocopy a few pages
from the manual.
Bytek was of no help.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks

If the sensor headers look like this:

live signal [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]    [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [X]

+5v         [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]    [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
ground      [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]    [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [X]
sensor#      15  14  13  12  11  10  9   8   7      6   5   4   3   2   1   0

Then for sensor 0, you use the header pins marked as [X].

If you are sure you have a 10K resistor, and you are using the correct
pins, and you are getting a reading of 5 or 6 (not 40), then this
suggests that the resistor pack value is wrong.  You should have a 47K
resistor pack.  If a 10K resistor yields a value of 5 or 6, you might
have a 470K resistor pack soldered down between the +5v and signal
rows.

re: DL, thanks for your observations.  I'll take note of it.

Tom, it seems that your routines measure frequency but Yoni wanted to
count transitions.

Yoni, the approach is similar to what Tom has done in that you must
use the timer input channels to get high frequencies.  In the TCTL2
register, set the input lines to interrupt on either rising or falling
edges.  Create an interrupt routine that increments a memory variable
on each interrupt, and then resets the interrupt flag for the next
time.

Each transition on the timer input pin with then cause the memory
variable to be incremented.

you can use the mobile robot programs as long as you make appropriate
changes for where you have mounted the sensors and motors.

Hi,

After 2 weeks of trying to reset/set the config reg. I have had no luck
using
any computer or software. I really need to get these chips to work and am
willing to ship out to anyone who has experience in setting the conf reg.
I have no other idea's, at this point any help is welcome.

    Does anyone know the factory preset of the config on these chips, or if
they can even be changed or used in the handyboard?

Thanks,

Quinn Marshal

Hello,
I am currently designing an IR positioning system for our HB soccer
robot project
I think I have found schematics of an interesting IR beacon in Eagle
format. Unfortunately I
can't read Eagle schematics. Could so convert it for us in a JPG or one
another more
readable one?
Thanks for any help.

Please find attached the schematics file ir_pc.brd

I don't remember troubles trying to reset configs on the e2's, but
it's possible i never tried to disable the eeprom.

have you tried using motorola's pcbug utility?

I have PCbug running and I can boot the hc811, after reading the motorola
"Pink book"  and the tec. docs I cant find anything on how to set the congif
register. Does anyone know how to do this with the Pcbug software.

The strange this is I cant get them to set to anyting in the config reg.,
eeprom or not, the whole register is FF from 0 to F, (could the entire
config register be erased?, and can i re-enter the whole thing not just the
first bit).
I am guessing this is the problem because all my other 6811's have other
values in the config register and the first bit is 0C, but on mine its all
FF throughout.

This weekend, I got my HandyBoard running! Everything went fine, exept
that the pice of paper which was glued on my battery pack turned out to be
a theft-protection: it contained a magnetic layer, which caused
short-circuit, but after solving that, everything worked.
Now I'd like to program the board ofcoure. The point is, I can't really
start to program.
I can type one line, and as soon as I press ENTER, the line is executed.
Is there another way of programming IC than writing the program with my
text editor, load it in IC, read error-messages, and go back to the editor
to debug? 'Cause when executing 'IC -config' (on a dos / win'95
machine), I can type the name of a editor, which at default is emacs or
something, which I don't own (and which is a Unix program, I thought.) Is
there a way I can use DOS' Edit from with in IC (e.g. by pressing a magic
key-combination?)

Hello all,

I'm currently trying to communicate between the Handy Board and a PC (i486) 
using the existing serial line between the two. Sending data from the handy 
Board to the PC is no problem. An interrupt handler puts all incoming serial 
data into a buffer, which the main program can read from.

Sending data from the PC to the Handy Board is another story. The serial 
routines on http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rsargent/ic/serialio.html work fine if 
the PC isn't sending very fast. The current 'solution' is to put the PC in a 
short loop after it has sent a character to slow it down. But that's not a very 
elegant solution.

Is there a way to use the same technique on the handy Board as on the PC (using 
an interrupt handler)? If so, has anyone used that approach and is willing to 
share this code?

If there is a simpler way of doing things, I would also be glad to know about 
it.

Jan Sipke van der Veen

Hi all,
These questions are probably pretty trivial, but please bear with me, as I
have only been using IC for 2 days:
1.  I was under the impression that the files I loaded onto my HB would
remain there when I turn it off, I mean, the pcode does, but when I load
files or functions (for example lib_hb.c) using IC, they aren't there the
next time I run IC.  Is this normal?  If so, and they get deleted when I
quit IC, what do I need to do when I want to cut the umbilical and have my
robot roll around on its own?

2.  When I use the 'mem' command in IC, I get '<some number> of bytes on
host',  where <some number> appears to be 32K minus the size of the files I
have loaded.  Is this how much memory is left on my HB or my PC?  If it
shows how much memory is left on my PC, is there a way to find out how much
of the 32K is still available on the HB?

Thanks,
-patrick

you could write an ICB driver that accepts the incoming serial char
interrupt and buffers it up.

other than that slowing down the PC is probably the best option.

If there is ANYONE out there who can give me just a little guidance on
these two issues, or at least the first and most important one, I would
certainly appreciate hearing from them...  an extended treatise isn't

Subject: Sonar

I finished hooking up my 6500 sonar tonight, and it does nothing.
Actually, the Handy Board's BATT light comes on, which indicates to me that
there is a short some where along the lines.  I checked my wiring and
everything seems to be okay.  I did accidently plug in the power to the
sonar backwards.  Is is possible I fryed something?

Any suggestions?  How does one know when it works, as I believe someone
mentioned they heard their's click.

Thanks much,

Earlier I complained about the BATT light coming on, but then stupidity was
pushed out of the way and I realized the battery was almost dead, so I
plugged in the charger and put it on Zap.

Sonar still does nothing, but the diodes got pretty warm.  As cheezy as
this might sound to you EEs, which side do you put the + power on.

Hi,
I am programming a 6.270 board with IC and wondered if there was any way of
'uploading' data from the board back to my PC? or would the only way to get
the data be to print it out on the screen....
Thanks,
Ruth

re: #1,

in a sense, the stuff you downloaded *is* there, but IC doesn't know
how to access it until you re-download.  So yes, each time you restart
IC, you must re-download your project.


re: #2.

there are not good reporting tools for memory usage.  i think the
'mem' command reports free memeory in the IC application, which isn't
that relevant.

the way that the 6811 memory is partitioned is follows, there is
basically 16K for user code.  There is no way to free up more space
without recompiling IC.   Here are some more details.


user program object code + user global variables	16320 bytes available
runtime OS						 7936 bytes used
stack space for user processes				 6656 bytes used
buffer for interaction process				  256 bytes used
buffer for printing					  256 bytes used


When downloading your code, IC tells you how many bytes are going
down.  You've got 16,320 available.

I read in the Motorola MC68HC11 reference manual that the hardware 
mode select pins are "MODB" and "MODA" (pins 2 and 3). If the following
table is true (copied from the manual),

              INPUTS                  MODE
          MODB  MODA          DESCRIPTION
       ---------------------------------------
           1     0                 Normal single chip
           1     1                 Normal expanded
           0     0                 Special bootstrap
           0     1                 Special test

then, if MODB is always 0, the chip can only ever be in
Special Bootstrap or Special Test mode.
In the schematic of the CPU and Memory Circuit on the Handy Board
Web page, MODB is tied low, so how can the chip ever be in Normal
Single Chip mode?

Subject: a scary story
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Just an interesting (or perhaps not) story about what just happened to me 
this week while putting my Handy-Board together. I was on the section 
where you put on the digital input circuitry, and all was going well so far - it 
loads pcode_hb.s19, hooks up to IC and executes commands from the PC. 
So far so good, but having loaded HBTEST.C and trying to run 
"testdigitals()", nothing happened when I pressed START. OK, started 
debugging and then things started going terribly wrong. Somehow I fried an 
led and then the display started to act funny. I could still download 
"pcode_hb.s19" and connect to IC, and even execute commands, but the 
display was either displaying nothing, or displaying half of the "startup 
display message" or displaying it in bits... It was really weird. Then, it 
stopped communicating with the computer altogether, which wasn't good, 
so I really thought I'd actually fried something else. I tested the memory and 
the address latches and they were OK, and then miraculously, it worked!
After loading the pcode though, you had to flip the on/off switch (as the 
handy board doesn't have a RESET switch) to start the IC programme.
However, it kept losing the pcode when I did this. I eventually worked out, 
that if you flick the switch very fast, this doesn't happen, so now I only 
have to debug the digital inputs again.

Yup.  I loaded the sonar.c file and ran the sonar_display() routine.  It
just displays values that make no sense.  The sonar doesn't click and the
diodes get hot.  After recieveing some mail from other, I have come to the
conclusion that the diodes are hooked up properly.  What could be causing
the heat?  Is there a short somewhere?

Thanks all,
Mike

Hello all,
            I am attempting to use the shaft encoder routines but am =
having trouble.When I try to load the file fencoder0.icb I get a message =
that ic cannot find the file.Any hints?
   Also I would like to know whether these routines count off one edge =
of a pulse or what dictates how the count is incremented.

I've decided to write an interrupt routine for the handling of serial data on 
the Handy Board. An example of an interrupt routine is given in the Handy Board 
technical reference. This works like a charm. I've modified it to use the SCI 
interrupt. The code is listed below.

No interrupts seem te occur. The test is like this:

* Start IC
* load myfile.icb
* load myfile.c  (* in main : *)
  poke (0x3c, 1);
  printf ("%d", foo);
  int_init (0);
  start_press ();
  printf ("%d", foo);
* Exit IC
* reset Handy Board
* it prints: 55
* send a character to the Handy Board (in Borland Pascal)
* press Start button
* it prints: 55


Can anyone see the mistake here?
Hope I'm not too annoying with all my questions.

We've used small RC car motors etc. in our Lego robot course in past years,

	Performance-wise, they are okay (i.e., they are powerful enough).
I don't like the short axle they have on them, though (compared to e.g. a
Mabuchi motor with a LEGO 2x drilled axle Super-Glued onto the motor shaft),
because gears (especially worm gears) slip off of them.  With a longer
axle, you can use a half-bushing on either side of the gear to lock it down.

	They are indeed terribly overpriced...just like the SPST switch in
a LEGO brick for $20, and the photoresistor in a LEGO brick for $26.

Hi Greg,
I have been using LEGO 9v motors for a few years and I am very pleased with
the results.  I run freshman and sophomore engineering design and computer
science courses using LEGO kits and HB's.  The motors are well worth the
price if you are integrating with LEGO.  My students have built Nerf
basketball playing robots, a successful IEEE micromouse, and very successful
Trinity fire-fighting robots (including first place in 1997) using LEGO
motors.  I used surplus DC motors in the past, but we encountered too many
problems including mounting/interfacing to LEGO, alignment, current demands,
etc.  Good luck.

	Yes, this is very possible, and I've done a fair amount of work for
various experiments where I needed to get data back from the board.  First,
you should check out http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rsargent/ic/serialio.html
for the routines that the 6.270 and Handy Board that let you disable the
communication stream between IC and the board and then send your own data
over the main serial link.

There are also Richard Drushel's routines, which implement some basic
functions to send/receive data between the board and a host computer.
These routines can be found at
http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/contrib
/drushel/ and have worked very well for me.

On the PC side, you'll have to either open up a terminal window to the COM
port you have the board on (9600 baud, no handshake), or write a software
program to handle the data.  I use Linux to talk to my HB, which simplifies
programming quite a bit and works very well overall for data logging,
remote control, etc.  One of my current projects is using the HB to
activate the PTT circuit on an amateur radio in an effort to set up a
remote control station.  Doing that sort of thing is very simple in Linux,
while a monster in Win95 or DOS.

Linux serial routines can be found on the Linux Documentation Project HOWTO
page or on sunsite, etc.

Hope this helps!

I've used lego motors and have found them much better than other motors
i have tried for torque. The ease of integrating them into lego buggies
is obviously a major bonus aswell!

Lego motors are OK ptrformance wise (if youre talking about small robots),
but the cost is really bad.
What I would recommend is taking surplus motors and superglueing them
together to lego bricks. Especially for photsensors and switches.

Jan-Sipke,

You're really pretty far away from having this work.  It's not just a
matter of redirecting the serial interrupt; when you get there, you
have to:

* store incoming character in a buffer
* advance the buffer pointer
* check the buffer for overruns

then you need a separate subroutine which fetches the character from
the buffer (checking first if there is anything there), and decrements
the buffer point.

learning how to write interrupt code is probably the hardest part of
assembly programming.  my best advice to you is to simply write code
on the PC side to slow down your transmit character rate until things
work. and make sure on the HB side, you're in a tight loop receiving
characters when communications are in progress.

Sipke obviously realizes that more work is needed,
and justs want to get to step 1 first by
recognizing the interrupt.  That is exactly what I
would do too.

I've been thinking about writing an
interrupt-driven serial receive routine too, but
haven't had the time for it yet.  Such a method
would be magnitudes better than the 'tight-loop'
reception method which I find always gives me
trouble once my program gets complicated enough to
not run as fast as I would like.

On the other hand, maybe there's a comprimise
approach:  Try writing 'C' code that you run as a
seperate high priority process to poll for serial
input and buffer it, and add a support routine
that your normal code can call to pull characters
out of that buffer.

Everyone is complaining about the price of LEGO motors.  There is a
new product, a gear reduction motor, that is a great value.  It is a
super efficient DC motor with a built in gearbox that can be used for
direct drive, or with one stage of gear reduction.

At $24.50, it's cheaper than any gear motor but those found
sporadically on the surplus market.  Plus it's fully LEGO compatible.

It should be available now, but might still be delayed for a couple of
months.  Call PITSCO  (800) 362-4308 to get a catalog.  I don't know
the part # offhand, but it's the "9v gear reduction motor."  You might
need to get 9v connector leads as well.

If the diodes are getting hot, it does indicate a short.

Yes -- I didn't think very hard and in retrospect it's fairly evident
that Jan-Sipke's code is just the starting step.

Sorry for being such a blunderhead.

(Jan-Sipke and I have been exchanging some private messages and I
think he's closing in on a solution.)

Hi
    Ive elected to use 2 relays to run a motor. Im going to put one motor on
with the power coming in 'straight' and the other one in reverse of the
first one:

    [RELAY 1]       [RELAY 2]
    ++          --         --           ++   (power is inverted)

       |--------|            |-----------|
       |          \_______           |
DIODE                      \        DIODE
       +-----------------+   \            |
                               |     \           |
HB motr port 1:    X    X-------+


Will this method work effectively by allowing only 1 relay to work at once?

One other question: What could I use in place of a diode, since the motor
ports operate at a higher voltage and amperage than most diodes are. Or how
ca I effectively reduce the power output of the HB?

Thanks alot!
phil

I think the file is named fencdr0.icb by default (not fencoder.icb).  Maybe
it's just that simple (I hope)?  Also, it's probably easiest if it's in the
directory with all the other stuff you're loading (the lib directory).

These encoder routines seem to simply monitor the analog port and increase
the count whenever the reading drops below the low threshold or goes above
the high threshold.  The simple way to set these threshold values is to
print the value on the analog port repeatedly in a loop while spinning the
shaft around, and making a note of the low and high readings.  My
Hall-effect magnetic sensors, for example, only range between about 110 and
135, so I set the low threshold to 115 and the high to 130, and they work
great.  Your results will vary depending on the type of sensors you're using
(IR transceiver, etc.), but if you calibrate them correctly, you'll be off
by just a constant factor.

Try the slow versions of the routines first (e.g. sencdr0.icb) instead of
the fast ones, since the slow ones are more efficient.  Good luck.

In my experience, it doesn't matter how slow the pulse is.  The count is
increased each time the analog port value crosses outside of the middle
range defined by the two threshold values as shown below (please note that
you'll need to view this with a non-proportional font, like Courier):
          __              __
         /  \            /  \
high .../....\........../....\..........
       /:     \        /:     \
        :      \      / :      \      / 
 low ...:.......\..../..:.......\..../..
        :       :\__/   :       :\__/
        :       :       :       :
                                   time-->
count:  +       +       +       +

Of course, if you only want one count per period, you could just set one or
the other thresholds to an extreme value and the other to a mid-range value.
This allows you to count either rising or falling signals.

Good luck to you and your robot.

The handyboard has to stay in special test mode so that it can switch
into and out of 'single chip' mode at will. This is necessary to operate
the LCD (which uses either a clever or gross hack depending on your
taste). If you are writing code using something other than IC you can
modify the board to stay in extended chip mode (all RAM is accessible)
and then you'll need a new LCD circuit or module.

I am wanting to add speech to the Handy Board.  I am currently
looking at interfacing a SPO256-AL2 speech synthesizer chip and
have a very limited schematic that came with the chip many years
ago.  Does anyone have a nice set of schematics for doing this
or know where I could find some?  Also, is there a better chip
out there with the associated schematics?

  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,

hello!
    I pulled out my HB today and rtied playing around with the IR port. it
does not work for some reasons. I checked the remotes: they are still
transmitting!

Here are the steps I took: am I missing a step?

1. loaded sony-ir.icb
2. sony_init(1);
3. ir_data(n);

and it alwayys returns a zero ,even when Im sending remote signals. So this
means that the IR receiver on the HB is shot, right? Is there anythig else
that may be acting up?
thanks alot!

Subject: using the MC34064 LVI
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,

This is a warning for anyone considering using the Motorola MC34064 to replace
the DS1233. I have just built a couple handyboards and I had some problems
getting them working. I finally tracked the problem done to the LVI. I used the
MC34064 instead of the DS1233 because I had some laying around. WARNING the pin
out on the two is not the same:

Pin  DS1233  MC34064
 1    GND    *RESET
 2   *RESET    +5
 3     +5     GND

The MC34064 can be used but it must be rotated 120 degrees so that the signals
will be correct.

-- Jeff

You have to re-write the bit_delay loop to take up four times as much
time.  Just multiply the delay count value by four, e.g., "LDAB #148".

Fred

(following is the 9600 code.)

* take up 0.1042 millisecs
* 208 cycles
bit_delay
	LDAB	#37
bit_loop
	DECB			; 2 cycles
	BNE	bit_loop	; 3 cycles
	RTS

Subject: Digital input cct
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


Hi there, I'm in the middle of building a handyboard and I'm having a lot of 
problems. 
I'm on part 7.2 (Digital Input cct) and the testdigitals(); function in hbtest.c 
doesn't respond to the start button. All the chips and RP1 are installed 
properly and none are getting hot. While testing pin1 of U5, the yellow 
Charge LED on the I/C board lights up fully. Is this supposed to happen, as 
I suspect it's not good.
I just tried it now, and even when testdigitals(); is not running, it still does 
the same thing, in fact, it stops any communication between the board and 
the computer. This is part of my final year project and I've been stuck on 
this for ages. If anyone could help, I'd really appreciate it.
Thanks,
   Rob O' Neill

I have been using very successfully for two months now, the code in the
attached zip file. It has Interrupt Driven Transmit & Receive functions, both
are buffered.
    I found the code easy to adapt for my specific task. Messages can be
"Canned", Fixed, or variable length.
    *** I found this on the Net somewhere, but cant remember now. All rights

  The second thing I noticed in your mail was looking for ways to control Data
flow to keep your PC & HB syncronized.  There is a solution built into the
attached software as well  !!  Its commonly known as "XON / XOFF Flow
control".   If the software receives $11 in the buffer it turns ON the
transmitter , allowing data to be sent - this is XON.   Alternatively, if the
software receives $13 in the buffer it turns OFF the transmitter , stopping
data  transmission- this is XOFF. 
      A similar technique could be used at the PC end for controlling data
from the PC.

  Many Regards,

Terry Howsham

Subject: Expanding the memory of the handyboard

A number of students that used the handyboard in our Mechatronics 
competition needed substantially more memory than the 16,320 bytes 
currently available.  What options are there to add memory to the 
handyboard?


Thanks to everyone who contributes to handyboard@media.mit.edu

re: #1,

in a sense, the stuff you downloaded *is* there, but IC doesn't know
how to access it until you re-download.  So yes, each time you restart
IC, you must re-download your project.


re: #2.

there are not good reporting tools for memory usage.  i think the
'mem' command reports free memeory in the IC application, which isn't
that relevant.

the way that the 6811 memory is partitioned is follows, there is
basically 16K for user code.  There is no way to free up more space
without recompiling IC.   Here are some more details.


user program object code + user global variables	16320 bytes available
runtime OS						 7936 bytes used
stack space for user processes				 6656 bytes used
buffer for interaction process				  256 bytes used
buffer for printing					  256 bytes used


When downloading your code, IC tells you how many bytes are going
down.  You've got 16,320 available.

Hey! Im a realitivly clueless High school guy.  Our Adventures in
Supercomputing group is making a mobile robot using a handyboard and 3 or
4 infared sensors.  Is tyhe bouncey ball method a good one for having a
rover permeate a halled area?  the thinking behind this method is that if
you throw one of those dangerously bouncey super ball bouncey balls they
go everywere, out the cracked window, into the dogs food bowl, into the
guest room.  Anyway...just wondering.

Dear Kevin,

Please forgive this non-answering of your question, but I am curious
as to what kinds of hardware projects/software objectives were your
students working on when they ran out of 'hc11 memory, and how did
they deal with this circumstance?

I'm curious how you went about securing the motors to your robots.  I
picked up a couple yesterday, and they do seem to be very good quality
motors, but just sticking them on "the LEGO way" doesn't work too
well.  They keep ripping themselves loose and falling out.  Did you
end up drilling through the bricks and using screws, or did you glue
them in place, or what?

Dear Fred,

The Mechatronics class competition was to build autonomous miniature 
forklifts that would navigate a complex course.  In the course, the 
forklifts had to identify, pick up, and deliver three.  The path that the 
forklifts had to negotiate became increasingly difficult for each pallet 
they encountered.  They determined the ID of the pallet from a barcode 
label.  They received material handling instructions (i.e. which bay to 
take the pallet) and traffic information from a IR Tower that broadcast 
instructions from the center of the course.  They also had to negotiate a 
"factory door" that they sensed to determine if it was closed. Pictures of 
the competition can be seen at  http://www2.et.byu.edu/~eetwww/Mfet548/

The students handled the memory limitation by eliminating as many of the 
programs loaded at start up that they could and making their code as 
concise as possible.

The Handyboard is very useful and the students really enjoyed working with 
it.  However, the memory limitation was a problem for the students that did 
the best in the competition.  One of the students, Richard Abbott, asked 
the same question back in November but I didn't see any responses.  Since 
the topic of memory came up was hoping someone might be willing to share a 
solution - if there is one.

The idea to have a Mechatronics competition came from seeing your work at 
MIT, and the Handyboard greatly facilitated building the forklifts.  For 
this I want to say thank you.  It made big difference in the class.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kevin

The Lego motors are sized such that they can be "pinned" to the frame of a
Lego robot easily.  With a horizontal beam beneath the motor and another
across the top, a pair of six-unit beams can be pinned vertically to the
horizontal beams using the Technics black pins, resulting in a bomb-proof
assembly.  My entire robot chassis is built this way, and so it's guaranteed
not to come apart unless I take it apart.  For details on the general Lego
pinned structure technique, see "The Art of LEGO Design" link at the bottom
of the Docs page on the Handy Board site.  Good luck.

Sure did.  I used a ceramic disk capacitor...  Hope that was okay to use.
I just can't find what the problem is with the ranging board.  For all I
know, it has never worked.  This is my first attempt at using it.  There
really isn't a whole lot to the board, and I am generally confused what
could be causing a short.

I'm just wondering, is the "charge" LED supposed to come on on the I/C 
board when you're running code on the Handy-Board? I don't think it should, 
but I'm not sure.

assuming the battery is not yet connected (which would be the case of
you're building the HB and following the directions),

the charge LED means that the HB is drawing some current.

Does anyone know if you need IC 3.x to run the pulsewidth measuring functions provided by Thomas Hauri??

Subject: Thanks Fred et al...

        My first scratch-built HamdyBoard has passed all of it's tests and
is up and running.  I've only been looking for something like this for about
twelve years, so I'm REAL happy. I especially appreciate the emphasis on
both hardware and software development in the HB program, and your continued
support of the community.  Again, thanks.

        Other notes:  BG Micro (www.bgmicro.com) has a quantity of 'A1FN
chips for 6.95 each.  These are used, and look it, but the three I bought
seem to work.
        If you're running HBDL in Windows and have trouble configuring the
register at 0x0C, try running the DL.EXE that comes with shareware IC from
the DOS prompt.
        I also have 6 extra IS1U60's available at cost plus postage if
anyone is interested.

How did the board read the barcode label? What equipment/algorithm

I've been screwing around with a train, and haven't really had any
luck with reading a barcode from the track as it passes over.

We used OEM barcode reader (IS4120-41 scanner decode engine) from 
Metrologic Instruments, Inc..
The output of this reader is the barcode ASCII format transmitted across an 
RS232 line.  We read this with the handy board's RS232 serial port.  You 
can slow down the data transmission on the barcode reader so that you do 
not have to use interrupt driven software on the handyboard's side. 
 However, in our competition seeing the barcode was frequently an 
asynchronous event and an interrupt driven approach worked the best.  They 
are only about an 1.5"x1.5"x0.5" in size and they worked great.  The 
address for the barcode reader supplier follows:

Hello I=B4m a beginner. I have problems download pccode in my HB.
I=B4ve a Mac G3 and I use Init board HB 7.2 modem & 6811 Downloader.
I,ve check connections, batteries and the board is in download mode.
Bat/pwr LEDs light on (1/3 second) and turn off.
When is downloading, power LED is flickering.
The error messages are:
- Init board HB 7.2 modem "Time out"
- 6811 Downloader "sinchronizing failed"
The HB is made by Gleason research and is tested.
I,ve used the HB 3 months ago and it worked right (with another computer
, macintosh quadra).
Please tell me any solutions. Thanks

Laurent -- just to be clear -- your problem is that you can't
bootstrap your board from a G3 Mac, but after you do get it booted,
everything's OK?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

After seeing some of the recent e-mail to this list, I realize that we
should send out the following announcement to the Handyboard list.  IC
3.2 for Windows fixes the problems that a percentage of folks reported
about pcode download problems.

---------------------------------------

Newton Research Labs is pleased to announce Interactive C 3.2 for
Windows 95/NT.  Users of IC 3.1 for Windows 95 and Window NT are
encouraged to download IC 3.2 free of charge.  Your IC 3.1 licenses
are also valid for IC 3.2.  The new version includes minor
enhancements and bug fixes, including:

    * A "Go To Line" menu item,

    * Improved reliability for the initial download of pcode; IC will
      no longer incorrectly complain about the Config register on
      certain machines,

    * The interaction window can no longer be resized to zero size, and

    * A standard windows installation program makes installation easier.

Newton Labs is not releasing a new version of IC for UNIX and
Macintosh, as the bugs are Windows-specific.

Please visit the following web page to download IC 3.2 for Windows
95/NT:

    http://www.newtonlabs.com/ic/ic_download.html

The development team wishes to thank all the customers whose feedback
have helped make Interactive C the best integrated development
environment for Rug Warrior, Rug Warrior Pro, Handyboard, and MIT Lego
Robot Controller Board.

Dear Laurent and German,

I wish to publicly apologize for Newton Lab's slowness of response to
your messages of last fall.  You should know that the employee in charge
of handling IC sales and support during that time is no longer with the
company.  Please send IC sales requests to "sales@newtonlabs.com" or
"support@newtonlabs.com" to prevent your messages going to an unread
mail spool.  (I only have one message from either of you in the last
month, and that was from German on Wednesday asking to purchase a copy
of IC 3.1).

Furthermore, as you know we have been waiting for some time to be able
to take credit cards, which makes purchasing much more convenient for
overseas customers who do not wish to go through the trouble to generate
a money order in U.S. funds.  As of yesterday we are now (finally) able
to accept credit cards for IC purchase -- our bank took a lot longer
than we were originally led to believe.  This should make overseas
purchases like your own much easier in the future.

Again, I apologize for these two problems last fall, and I invite you to
try our service again.

-- Randy

    On a related note ...

    Sometime ago, someone(???) mentioned that he would attempt to build the
new motor routines into IC3.1. Would this by any chance be already in IC3.2?

Hi WW,

is your sonar a Polaroid 6500 series or something else ?
Where did you get it ?

What did you pay for it ?

Thanks,

Jan (Giovanni).

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hallo,

I am thinking about buying one of these things:

 Designer's Kit:
        1 transducer, 1 ranging module, electronics display accurate
        to 1/10th meter. Cost is $169
 OEM kit:
        2 transducers, 2 ranging modules. $99.

or:

#01, Transducer and Sonar Module Kit: $50 each PDF Data Sheet
Two or more kits: $47 each

The kit includes one 6500 Board, one 600 Series Transducer, cabling, and
a data sheet.

What do I need to work with the schematics and the software I found at
the HB site ?
Does anybody know of a vendor in the Netherlands ?
Or cheaper, different solutions to measure distance and proximity ?

Thanks in advance.

Jan.

I would recommend buying the one transducer and module for $50.  The extra
circuit that you would get with the designer's kit is totally unnecessary if
you have the Handy Board already.

You only save a few dollars by buying more than one unit, and hooking up the
second might be tricky.  You might want to try out just one at first.

One sonar unit is easy enough to connect using the instructions on the Handy
Board web site.  I'm looking into ways to connect a second unit.  I would
certainly appreciate any suggestions from others on how to do that.  I would
like to use as few input/output ports as possible, perhaps by sharing the
BINH or ECHO signals between the two (alternating between the two units as
necessary).  My biggest concern is whether the ECHO signal put out by one of
the units will harm the other unit, if the two are simply connected in
parallel to the same TIC port.  Can anyone tell me about that?  Thanks a bunch.

At the bottom of the following page are a couple links to vendors:

http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/sonar.html

(This page is on the Handy Board site; hit the Software link, then
Libraries, then follow the Polaroid sonar link.)

In addition, the Robot Store in California sells 'em, but they're a rip-off
($150/pair!) so I think you're much better off getting one from Wirz
Electronics or directly from Polaroid for about $50 each.  As far as I can
tell, it's the same item.

Hello everyone,

A few sonar questions (other than where to buy them):

1: The speed of sound has been widely quoted to be 0.9 ft/ms (274m/s),
   but my Physics text lists it as 343 m/s (at 20C/70F), which is about
   1.13 ft/ms, or 25% faster.  So why the 0.9 value (or just cuz
   the Polaroid guys say so)?

2: The sonar routines (e.g. sonar_sample()) return the distance as an
   int, meaning the greatest round-trip distance possible is 32768 
   half-microsecs, or 8192 microsecs one-way.  By my math, 8.2ms is
   about 3m (10 ft).  Is this our max distance?  Any way to improve
   this?

3: My sonar works well, but about 10% of the time it returns a spurious
   low value (around 2200 counts/8 inches), even if nothing has moved
   or changed in the environment.  I have written a kludge to simply
   re-pulse if it receives such a result, which works fine, but it's
   ugly and I'm just treating the symptom, not the cause.  Any ideas
   why this is?  (I'm using sonar_closeup(), BTW)

4: I'm confused by the guts of the sonar routines.  The start_time is
   read from the system TCNT register as a 16-bit integer (max 32768
   counts).  If TCNT increments 2,000,000 counts/sec, does this mean 
   TCNT rolls over every 16ms?  If so, it seems quite likely that the
   counter will roll over while we're waiting for a pulse to return
   depending on when we peek it for the start_time.  However, the 
   routines work fine, so can someone please clear up my 
   misunderstanding?

Cheers!  Skye.

My sonar seems to be pretty accurate. I would notice a 25% difference.
???
Check your calculations. Maybe you missed something.

Subject: Serial problems

Hello,

I am trying to get my handyboard working after it has been in a box for a
long time.  It used to work flawlessly but now I am having trouble
downloading the pcode.
I did all of the checks for the serial/charger board in the assembly
instructions and it seems to be working fine (The Max232 is outputing 9.59
& -9.59) and the LED flickers appropriately.
I run the download app and the light on the serial board flickers and the
green LED on the handyboard lights (after being off for bootstrap mode) and
I get the following output from the downloader:

Please place board in download mode and press RETURN
To quit, press Q
For help, press H
Downloading 256 byte bootstrap (229 data)
................................................................
................................................................
................................................................
.....................................___________________________
Timeout on serial receive.  256 chars left to receive
Perhaps the board was not connected properly or not in download mode


I have tried everything I can think of.  I have used about a million
different phone cords.  I've tried different options for the downloader.
I've tried 2 different macs & a PC.  I used all the different downloaders I
could find.  No dice...
Does anyone have any suggestions?   I've gone over the serial board, it
seems ok.  Where should I start looking on the handyboard for problems?
Thanks,

		-Jeremy

I have recently obtained a digital compass circuit as part of a clock
(it lights an led that points north) but haven't yet tried to interface
with it. I think it will be communicating via SPI but I'm not sure.

The question I want to ask anybody with a V2X is what cpu does it use on
the board ?.

Thank for any help.

Also. The Robot Builders Bonanza has a similar circuit. The price for the
parts should be under $10.00. Has anyone tried this circuit?

>Also. The Robot Builders Bonanza has a similar circuit. The price for the

Yeah, it doesn't work :) That's why I designed my circuit in the first place.
I tore my hair out for a couple of weeks trying to figure out what I was
doing wrong. I finally realized it wasn't me, it was the circuits in the book
were just plain wrong. So instead of figuring out where the author messed up,
for me it was just easier to redesign the darn thing. The writeup though in
the book that goes along with the circuit seems to be pretty accurate. That
was the information I used to build my circuit.

Good questions!!

The polaroid number/widely quoted number is 0.9 MILLISECONDS
PER FOOT -- or 1.11 ft/ms.  hence the conversion matches!

I think also I have this wrong on my HB sonar page!  This confused me
for a while too.

Yes, this is correct.  The routines would have to be smarter to deal
with longer time periods/distances.

I've always chalked this up to "sonar is flaky."  i haven't
played with it enough to better characterize it.

anyone who has some more sonar experience would be welcome to
contribute observations here.

As a 16-bit number TCNT's range is 0 to 65535, or 32.768 ms of time.
I don't think I quite understand your question here, but remember that
the actual time of TCNT when the ping returns is automatically
captured by the 6811 timer system and stored in timer 3's TIC3
register.

So while we're waiting for the return pulse, it doesn't matter how
long after it occurs that we make the calculation, b/c the value is
already captured.

Yes!  I have been working from your sonar page, but as a sanity check 
I checked the Polaroid sheet again.  Whoops!  At least we were both 
tripped up by it.  I'm used to seeing the "speed of sound" (ft/ms) 
quoted, not the "slowness of sound" (ms/ft)!  

aside: Using my trusty tape measure I calculated a speed of 1.09 ft/ms 
(330 m/s) so it *is* pretty close.

Aren't IC 16-bit integers only signed, and therefore -32k to +32k?
Does it thus return times from -16ms to +16ms, 32ms total?  Or is this
somehow an unsigned integer?  I know signed/unsigned integers differ
only in the interpretation of the sign bit, but how does *IC* interpret
this 16-bit time?

True, but we aren't *initializing* the timer to zero when we send the 
pulse, are we?  It is my understanding that we only *sample* the timer 
when the pulse leaves, and then have it automatically sampled again when
it returns.  Thus subtraction yields the time-of-flight.  But (if this
is true) what happens if we send the pulse (and sample the timer) just
before it rolls over?  Then the return time is recorded *after* the
rollover and our time-of-flight is boned.  Or does it not work this
way at all?

Thanks for the prompt reply!  Cheers, Skye.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi all

if anyone has problems using the 6500 series for distances below 35cm by
using the binh signal I have a possible solution to the problem. We also
expierienced problems using the sensors for distances between 15cm and
40cm. We finally found out that the digital chip (TL851) on the 6500
board gets huge voltage spikes making it detect an echo even if there
was none.
We solved the problem by adding an additional capacitior to the
powersupply.

THE REWORK
Solder a tantal c (1uF) directly to pin 3(Gnd) and pin 1 (+) of chip U2
(TL851).

This will filter the spikes keeping them from droping below 2.5 V.
If anyone has a better way of solving this problems please tell me.

I didn't actually buy the clock, the company that I work for was
scrapping a load of stuff from one of it's buildings and these clocks
were some of it. The company said if we gave 2 pounds to charity we
could have a clock. They have been very popular so there are none left.
I am hoping to make use of the compass section as a heading indicator
for a walker robot but I haven't worked out if the cpu is spi compatible
or if it uses the same commands as the V2X.

The V2X only costs 50 USD from Jameco and these clock were probably sold
for 100 - 200 GBP (166 - 333 USD) so I was just lucky.

John,
My v2x has these numbers on the cpu        6448
                     			           PN11096	 
					V2XC JJJ
I have a handyboard , a v2x compass  and small robot platform with left and
right steering motors. Everything works, I can run the motors,load
compass.icb and compass.c and the lcd will print the heading constantly
when I type  v2x( ); at the command line.
My problem is lack of knowledge programming. I would like to know if any
one has a complete program that I could run and learn from.
Just a program that I could have my robot go one direction for a certain
number fo wheel rotations or length of time then turn another direction
ect,ect,ect. I think I could make changes rotations and directions ect. if
I had a working program to start with and study.
Thanks
Terry P.Gathright

Make sure you don't have any bright light shining down on your board.
Too much light saturates the sensor and you get 0 or 255 all the time.
I thought my IR port was bust for a long time until I turned off my desk
lamp one day.  I hope your solution is this easy!

Cheers, Skye.

The all-in-one remotes usually only send Sony-compatible signals after
setting the proper mode.  I had to refer to my owner's manual to figure out
which buttons to push to put it in Sony mode.  Make sure yours is set
properly.  Good luck.

Hi German,

I'm not sure why this message got re-forwarded to the handyboard mailing
list.  I was cc'd on the key that our order department e-mailed to you
last week;  if you still have not received it please let me know.

We appreciate everyone's patience while we got our new credit card
system up and running with our bank.  (It's running smoothly now).

I have a question for you, how much does the compass deviate when the motors
turn on. As an ex-sailor, one of the major consideration in using magnetic
compasses is deviation, and on a small bot, the deviation would vary due to the
changing electromagnetic fields. So have you turned on the compass, and watched
to see if the reading varyied if the motors turn on and off?

Just wanted to know.
Thanks

Subject: Sonar Multiplexor Question
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

To anyone on the list:

I would like to drive 3-4 transducers from a single Polaroid
sonar ranging unit.  Adam Cox posted a circuit for doing this
on the HandyBoard page -- I have a few questions regarding
this and possible alternative solutions.

Has anyone implemented this or some other sonar multiplexor
on the HandyBoard?  Any feedback?

Also, in Adam Cox's solution, there is a note to the effect
that, to avoid damage to the Ranging Unit, a single transducer
must always be switched into the circuit.  Does this mean that,
while transitioning between transducers, that two transducers
will be switched into the circuit (if only for a brief moment)?

Also, if I read this correctly, Adam Cox's solution will take
four additional digital outputs (in addition to two already
needed to interface the HandyBoard to the Polaroid ranging
unit).  It looks like a prerequisite for implementing this
solution will be to expand the # of HandyBoard digital outputs.

Does anyone have a sonar-multiplexor solution that doesn't
take up so many additional digital outputs?

Any suggestions or feedback will be greatly appreciated.

The URL for the multiplexor is:

Thank you!

Ive never done this before, but couldnt you do this?
    Buy a multiplexer that will take 2 outputs and multiplex it to 4
outputs, since you will only be driving one at a time. To each individual
output of the multiplex, wire the power to one outputting transducer and one
inputting transducer, and wire all of the recievers to the reciever portion
of the interface, and all the transmitters to the transmitter and of the
interface. Using the multiplexer, you are guaranteed that only one
multiplexing pair will be on at a time, uless you have a faulty chip.
Again, I have never worked with Polaroid sensors, but this does work with
motors, ETC

I notice that Adam's circuit uses all 4 available SCI outputs to select
the transducer, but the sonar board itself requires two of them already.  
Why not just get a 2-to-4 line demultiplexor, and use the remaining 2 
SCI outputs to select the transducer?  (i.e. 00,01,10,11)  If you can't
find one ('139 I believe) a demultiplexor can be easily made out of
a couple of NOT gates and a quad NAND gate (or quad AND if you need
active high outputs).

I have a question: why does Adam use open-collector NOT gates with
pull-up resistors?  Why not just use a totem-pole chip?  Any advantage?

Cheers, Skye.

You get 4 SPI output digital ports in the HB. Read the section in the FAQ
about the HB's digital outputs. These 4 can be used to select your
transducer.

You can pull one motor driver chip and get 2 more digital outputs. Kent
has routines that uses these two outputs to drive the Polaroid Sonar.

If I remeber correctly, Adam Cox has done just this to get 4 sonars
working with the HB!

About the damage thing...the damage is done when you connect NO sonar to
the ranger. Also, the ranger can be damaged only when it tries to FIRE a
transducer when there is none connected to it. Thus, the brief moment
you're talking about will expire prior to your attempt to fire the
transducer anyway. 

In addition, I don't beleive anyone has yet reported that they damaged
their ranger this way. If anyone has believed they damaged their ranger by
not connecting a transducer to it, please correct me.

Bill,
I have not been able to try that with the v2x onboard the bot so far, every
time I try to load anything while the v2x is running my handyboard wants to
crash.
Someone out there must have a code that they would be willing to share with
some of us less experienced IC furture code writers.
I plan to mount the v2x as far from the motors as possible even if it means
mounting on some type of mast and trying to shield it someway. I'll let you
know how it turns out when I get a workable code loaded.

My $0.02
Transducers poled in sequence can us a count to four (or more) circuit/chip.
One digital output can be used to advance the count.

Hello everybody,

I'm a new owner of the handy board and I have sereval problems to use =
the outputs and, as I'm new on the mailing list, I may ask questions =
already asked before or stupid questions so I apologize in advance.

Today, I have several different questions which are :

1 ) Is it possible to link 2 handy board thanks to the serial port ?
If possible, please be so kind to explain me (I want to transmit not =
only characters but also float and double so I think the program called =
serialio.c is not enough and I don't see hopw to use this base of code).

2 ) Is the last version of IC compatible with former ones  (i.e. if I =
write a program with the DOS version of IC, will it run on the last one =
) ?

3 ) I want to use the port D0..7 of the handy board to communicate with =
my own external expansion board but many questions appear :

Can anyone suggest a good place to get a "bolt in" (I'm a car guy!)LCD
that fits the handyboard nicely?? 
Also , does anyone know of a good parts supplier in Canada??? my local
supplier can't supply me with some of the stuff...

To anyone who can help:

I wish to setup a panning sensor array for
my platform using an RC servo, and I have
some questions on experiences with servo
brands.

I know that Futaba servos are well respected,
but they are also expensive.  Has anyone had
any (positive or negative) experiences with
Cirrus or Hitec servos?

Any feedback is welcome,

I have a sonar mounted on a panning servo, and I just bought an
el-cheapo Cirrus CS-50.  (It is functionally equivalent to a JR/Hitec
JR-507 or HS-300).  It works fine, although it is a noisy little bugger 
(but other servos don't seem much better).  It has enough torque to 
move a transducer around, and has a decent transit time 
(42.3 oz-in and 0.16s/60 deg at 4.8v).  I say go for it.

Cheers, Skye.

I've had very good luck with the Cirrus CS-70 which is basically a
Futaba S148 replacement.  It costs less than $10 and is available
mailorder from Hobby Shack (800) 854-8471.  I've modified a bunch of
these to act as wheel drive motors for small robots and haven't had a
problem with any of them. 

They have an even cheaper one, the CS-50 which should work fine for a
low-mass sensor array panning application.

Subject: robot contest at Penn State

Hi All,

The Penn State Abington College (Abington, Pa -- Phila., PA suburb) will
host a preliminary fire-fighting robot contest on Sat, April 4, 1998 at 3pm.
The fire-fighting contest is based on rules developed by Trinity College
Fire-fighting Robot Contest Program (see www.trincoll.edu/~robot).  We will
basically apply the same rules as developed by Trinity except that our maze
walls will be 10" high instead of 13" high -- this is to improve visibility
of robots by spectators.  The robot max height is still 12.25" but we are
requiring that the robots in the Penn state contest do not look over the
walls. The contest is to prepare robots for the  Trinity college event
(Hartford, Conn) on April 18-19.

The Penn State robot contest is open to all ages (you do not have to be a
student) as participants -- there is no registration fee (although you must
register) and there will be prizes awarded.  The event is open to the public
as spectators as well (no charge).

More details soon.  Please email me if you are interested in participating.

We currently have 3 teams of Penn State freshmen and sophomores registered
as well as several teams of high school students from the Phila. area (the
majority using HB's and LEGO's)

Subject: Cheap Lego gear motors

NEWS FLASH!

Any of you who, like myself, have been waiting for Dacta to deliver (some
time later this month) the Lego Technic 9V motor with gear reduction at
$24.50 each might want to consider cancelling your order, because Lego
Shop-At-Home (800-453-4652) has what they assure me is the exact same item
(#5225) for only $17.50 each, and shipping is at no extra charge.  Not only
are these cheaper, but they have a few in stock already.  If they're not
yanking my chain, then this is an incredibly good deal on gear motors that
plug right into the Handy Board.  Just thought you all might like to know.

Subject: Re: V2X Compass
Cc: robot-board@cmf.nrl.navy.mil, handyboard@media.mit.edu

Hello all:

I played with the V2X a year or so ago, and found that virtually anything
magnetic interferes with readings. I found that the wiring in my office
created false readings when the compass was moved around, especially if
close to the walls. Sometimes the heading would shift 180 degrees, when near
an operating wall outlet. I have two units, and each behaved the same.
Outside, there was no problem at all. They measured perfectly. These things
(at least mine) are very sensitive. I would imagine that permanent magnet
motors would also create a similar problem. I never mounted one in my bot,
as I thought there would be a major problem in navigation, due to the wall
wiring electromagnetism, as I like to run my bots indoors. 

Maybe yours are newer and improved versions, to where this is not so much a
problem. I would love to here if this is the case.

I would really appreciate any new information on ways to improve these
units. They definitely have major potential.

Kent

Hey! Im a high school kid playing around with a handyboard i got maybe a
week ago.  Do you guys know any reason why my IR sensors keep returning
255? I havent made the trip to Radio Shack to pick up an IR detector card
yet, but Ive tried a couple different sensors.  Ive also tried regular
light bulb lighting, fluorescant lighting and no lighting.  

Is this a good method for indoor robotic navigation?  Should I be trying a
different method?

Thanks,
Richard

Hi All,
I am making a Sumo Wrestling Robot at university.  the robot is totally
autonomous, and I was wondering if sonic transducers were the best for
"seeing" another moving robot.  Range is not necessary but desireable in
the sensor.  Previous robots of this kind have used the sonic
transducers and I was wondering if there was anything better?  I have
checked on the net but its very hard to find any information unless you
know where to look.
Thanks.

With sumo wrestling robots, I find that the high freqency noise from the 
robots and motors tends to confuse the recievers, expecially the metallic 
impact and collateral damage :)  

The ring is small enough that, though sonar is useful, greater success 
has come from feelers, optical, and infra-red sensors.

imho

We ordered a lot of our stuff from the states, delivery time wasnt bad
as long as they had it in stock...  you might try Electrosonic in
vancouver (www.e-sonic.com), but digikey and the like down in the States
are pretty good too. also, if you can find exactly what you want from
BG  Micro, they are fairly reliable and usually cheaper.

Good Luck!

        Digi-Key # 73-1037-ND  (Optrex # DMC-16249B)  works;

also    Mouser # 592-RCM2065R   (Rohm # ?????)  should work.

        Mind you, none of these bolt on unless you want to fab a couple of

Hello,

  I am having trouble with the serial_getchar function in serialio.  I 
would like to put a character into the received memory location directly 
without hanging the program.  From what I understand (0x102f) is the 
location, however I don't know how to put the character in there.

Can I poke a character in? If so, how?  I have tried and tried, but with 
no success.

Could someone explain how the serial_getchar works?

int serial_getchar()
{
  while (!(peek(0x102e) & 0x20));
  return (peek(0x102f));
}

Thanks,
Happy Handy Boarding!

Hi.  I keep trying to download programs into my handyboard and from the
console it seems to work, but often it wont even download the code due to
"Power Glitch" error messages.  I think the Handyboard homepage had
something about that being the wrong STR file, but i looked in there with
resedit and it is pcoder22.s19 instead of the pocde_hb.s19 which, from
what i read, isnt supposed to be there and is supposed to be the cause of
the Power Glitch error message.  Im pretty sure I havent drained the
batteries or anything.
Any ideas what is going on?

Also..If you dont mind, i have some other questions.  First of all, I'm
working with the handyboard and Interactive C for the first time. Im
basically depending on sample programs and the Handyboard user manual.  I
have about 5 weeks to get a program that i have already written debugged,
working, and probably revised.  My program that Ive written basically 
uses 2 IR sensor inputs to direct a mobile rover away from obstacles.  It
decides it is too close when the analog input is less than 100 on either
side and tells the motor the appropriate thing to steer away from that.

Is this a good method?  Im running out of time and I think the handyboard
knows it.  It is sitting there mocking me as i speak.  Hehe.  Thanks!

Hi all,
What is the procedure for hooking up the Radio Shack GP1U52X IR receiver to
the digital inputs of the Handyboard?, do I need a transistor between the
units output an the HBs digital input?.

Thanks,
Clancy.

You can try Farnell Electronics. Have a look at the on-line catalogue at
http://www.farnell.co.uk/uk/index.html
I had mine from there. They are quite happy to process private, credit
card orders and are pretty quick. Actually most of the tricky bits my
HandyBoard came from them.

Cheers

Pete

Hello all,

I have been having problems finding motors suitable to use with my Handy
Board(5-12v 600mA) but I do have two 3v motors with quite good gear boxes
and i was wandering what the best way was to use them?

Thanks,

Which serial port are you referring too?  I know that this is entirely
feasable with the SPI synchronous serial port, which is brought out on the
HB.  If you can afford 5 wires, I would recommend this port as it is a
bit easier to debug.

We used the V2X and, due to space considerations on our test platform,
placed the compass within 4 inches of the DC motors driving the vehicle.
We had no noteworthy error that we could attribute to magnetic coupling.

Hi Dave,
	You can get them from RS, they deal with the general public via a
company called Electromail (tel 01536 204555). The price for the HC11A1
was 7.5 GBP plus VAT and delivery, this was in the October 97 catalogue
so they may have increased the price slightly by now. Delivery is a bit
expensive for ordering less than 30 GBP worth of order (delivery is 4.60
for less than 30 GBP order, 2.95 for 30 to 79.99, 1.75 for 80 GBP or
more).
The Farnell website lists the same chip as about 11 GBP so checking out
Electromail is worth it, especially if you have access to an RS
catalogue or CD (Electromail sell the CD for about 5 GBP).

Hope this helps.

There are instructions on the Handy Board web site for how to sever the
motor power trace on the HB and plug in a separate battery pack for the
motors.  This allows you to use a motor battery of any voltage you like up
to about 36 V.

If you want to stick with the HB battery, try using the new Lego Technic
gear motor (#5225).  They're $17.50 ea. from Lego Shop-At-Home (800-453-4652).

Hey! I ResEditted my pcode_hb.s19 file that i got from netscape into the
Init application.  It then started up and said Fatal Error <> undefined
hex character.  Could somebody, if they have the time, send me copy of
this?  Im stuck here on an aging macintosh and not enough hard drive space
for any web browser.  Thanks!

I remember some lively discussions concerning the use of an ir sensor (like
from an ex-vcr) to locate objects, walls, etc.  I didn't have a handy board
at the time, but saved the messages for the time that I got one.  Well that
time is now, but I have paged down through all my saved email messages and
can't seem to find the ones I need.   

So I dismembered a dead vcr and got the ir receiver module out, it consists
of a pcb with a surface mounted 8-pin IC & a few resistors, a capacitor,
and the ir sensitive device.  It has three pins on it, obviously for
signal, ground and supply voltage, I got the ground pegged, it's pretty
obvious, but the other two just go to a couple of the pins of the IC. 
Anyone out there know how I can identify the other two?  The board has
'CMK-29EHB silkscreened on it, if that's any help.  Once I do figure this
out, I assume I can connect the out to one of the HB's digital inputs and
power it up (5 volts?) and it will go high (low?) when it gets a modulated
signal (at what frequency I have no idea).
This is about as far as I can get.  Anyone know where I can get more info
on using one of these to detect  ...stuff...   ?   including how to get an
ir led to put out a modulated signal that will be received by the receiver?
 ( I have the remote from the vcr, I expect to tear that apart to use its
ir led.)

any input from anyone will be much appreciated.
Thanks,

I am not sure what do you mean from the mail.
Could you try to download with an option to

If the VCR isn't totally dead, maybe you could plug in what's left of it and
probe the leads that used to go to the IR module for a live one?

The HB comes with a modulated IR beacon port (right next to the modulated IR
receiver).  I don't know how it works, but it looks like it's probably
similar to how the IR beacon on the 6270 board works.

If the VCR remote still works, though, why not use more of it than just the
IR LED?  Why not use the modulator that's built into it?  Then you'll know
it's at the correct frequency and sending the correct signal format.

Subject: Polaroid sonar connector

Does ANYONE out there know how I can get my hands on a couple of the sockets
that will accomodate the 9-pin Burndy connector plugs that come with the
Polaroid sonar modules?

I've searched the web, but haven't been able to find what I'm looking for.
I would like two of them, since I have two modules on loan to me (so I can't
modify them to use a different type of connector).

I realize that Dr. Fred Martin intends to include one of these connector
sockets in the design of the HB expansion board, and that this type of
connector socket is included on the Polaroid experimenter's board (which I
don't have), so they must be out there somewhere.  Polaroid hasn't been
returning my calls on this.  I would really appreciate any leads.  Even just
a manufacturer name and part number might help; a catalog name and item no.
would be even better!  Thanks.

In the Polaroid manual, the connector is referred to as a "Burndy 9
pin connector SLP9S-2".  

I once spoke to someone at Polaroid who gave me the cross reference
"JST 1B0579A" (don't know if it's Burndy or not).

I am pretty sure the cable is standard 1 mm flex cable, 9 conductor.
Digikey has a bunch of these connectors but only even conductor
counts!  However, interpolating part numbers, the device should be
Hirose Electric Co, Ltd.'s FH21-9S-1DSA.

Will, please let us know what you come up with.

Fred

Hello:
I wrote a program to collect data off an analog port.  I set up an int =
array.  I find that=20
the array could be no more that 70 or so before I get a stack overflow.  =
Sometimes the program loads and I get a runtime error #4.  I tried =
getting rid of all possible files, yet I could  not increase the array =
size.  Is there something I am missing? or is it that this is the limit =
because of available memory?
Also, is it possible to send data up to the host PC at a rate faster =
than 9600 baud?
Can you tell me how?

Thanks everyone for your help with the pcode_hb.s19 file.  You guys rule!
I asked if the seeminly abundant analog sensors are any use at all with
object detection and i got a pretty much split vote.  Ive been told these
are the wrong kinds and that they are only very useful with line
following.  Should I just switch to my alternative program of having
feelers and bump sensors or do you think it can be done with analog IR
sensors giving a return value for an object that enters the IR beam?

Thanks!

Does anyone know what the analog expansion header is used for? It's a
4-pin female header above the analog inputs. Has anyone used this header?

this will be used by any expansion board to multiplex multiple new
analog inputs into a single hc11 analog line.

Since I only have like a month and a half to get my little robot running
and Im kind of on shakey ground with the IR sensors, I wrote this failsafe
program. Like ive said before, Im not too familiar with Interactive C
and was wondering if you could take a quick glance over this code.
Im not sure if this is the most efficient way to program in this
navigational method or if i included multiple variables right of if i even
can.  Ill explail it first since simpletext does silly things with the
margins when i cut and paste...Its basically that you have 3 bump sensors
on the front of the rover, 7(left) 8(middle) and 9(right.)
Right and Left are like 5 inch long feelers.  Middle one is covering the
blind spot and is wider...its basically on constant table leg watch.
When it feels something it turns away or backs up.  

ALso....whats the deal with how long a motor will run for?  I know you can
designate what motor and how much power but can you tell the handyboard
exactly how long it will go?  

I utilized (or did my best too) the elif function. Yay!

Heres the code...

/* This is default touch navigation */
void main( )
{
     while(1) {
          if (digital(7) == 1) (digital(8) == 1) (digital(9) == 1)
          {
                 fd(1);
                 fd(3);
           } 
          elif (digital(7) == 0) (digital(8) == 1) (digital(9) == 1)
          { 
                 fd(1);
                  off(3);
                  sleep(1.2);
          }
          else
          {
                 printf("TOUCHIE FEELIE!/n");
          }
           if (digital(7) == 1) (digital(8) == 1) (digital(9) == 0)
           {  
                 fd(3);
                  off(1);
                  msleep(500);
           } 
           elif (digital(7) == 0) (digital(8) == 1) (digital(9) == 0)
           {
                  bk(1);
                  bk(3);
                  sleep(1.2);
            }
           else
            {
                  printf("Crystal Ship./n");
            }
      }

I have build the board described in my book "Mobile Robots" which is a
great book. I just got the board going after realizing it isn't a good
idea to
assume the pin outs of all 32K x 8 ram chips is standardized  :)

I was hoping someone could help with my current problem, wiring this 20
x 2 LCD screen to the board. Its a standard HD44780 controller but no
matter what base software I
load using Interactive C, the display shows nothing. By nothing I mean
no data, the LCD does turn on and you see the little black squares.  I
have checked my wiring about 50 times and the LCD is fine because I can
use it with PIC's and my basic stamp 2 processor. I use the 74HC10 as
described in my book rather than the 74hc132 and after looking at the
handy board schematics I don't think the LCD would be affected by this.
I have also tried using the rug warrior code (pcoderwl.s19 and
pcode_rw.s19) and those don't work either. When I run IC I can type 1+2;
and the board will respond with 3 so I know the board is working and
everything seems to be fine except that I get nothing on the LCD. The
LCD that I am using is a 20 x 2 Hitachi display. I am using the
68hc11A0FN fitted into a botboard which is then wired to a breadboard
with the ram and LCD.

Thanks

John

To all UK Handyboard Builders

As my skill at PCB manufacturing is strictly limited to very simple single
sided boards, is there anyone who could help out.

Either the name of a person/company who has produced a PCB for you

Or

A very nice Handyboard builder, who has the production facilities, could
produce the two boards for me for a reasonable price.

Is there anyone there that could help me of this initial stumbling block!!

Many thanks

Duncan

I am writing a PC program to communicate with the Handyboard via its
RJ11 jack using the serialio routines.  On the Handyboard side, all we
can do is poll the port, but what have people done on the PC side?  

It should be easy to just poll the port from the PC side too, but is
it better to use an interrupt-driven routine?  I have a stack of C/C++ 
books here, but none deal with the specifics of serial port 
communication.  Can anyone recommend a good resource?

I know people must have written bits of code to communicate with the 
Handyboard already, so before I reinvent the wheel, has anyone got a 
snippit of code that does this?  What are the implications of 
reading/writing from the serial port from Windows 95?

Cheers, Skye.

I use Linux to talk to my HandyBoard. I have written a couple of functions
(in plain C) to do so, and implemented a software handshake (even with low
speed PCs you have to do some sort of handshake). Of course, the merit is not
mine, I have mixed functions from people all over the net :-), but if someone
is interested I can send my code.

Regards,
Humberto

Hey!  Thanks Will for the groovy code! I debugged the bits the compiler
didnt love and am left with one error beyond my limited comprehension.
It doesnt like the bit with waiting for the start button that starts it.
It says it is undefined.  How do i define it?

Thanks!

No, however IC can access an integer value
declared in assembler, which amounts to the same
thing.

Just precede the definitition with the line
variable_C_name, where "C_name" is what you want
the variable to be called in IC.  I usually make
the C name the same as the assembler name as in
this example:


variable_global_variable
global_variable   FDB   0
.
.
.
    LDX       global_variable
    INX
    STX       global_variable

----------------

int silly_routine ()
{
    global_variable = global_variable + 1;
    return(global_variable);
}


-----------------

...Of course you have to load your ICB file before
your C file when you're doing this.

Also, please be aware that when you send mail to

Hi, everybody.
A little question that upset us :

We plan to use two handy-board : a master handy-board and a slave one.

The slave handy-board would make some difficult calculations for the master one and would send the results to this last one.
The master handy-board would send the data for the caculations to the slave one and would say to it to stop if needed.

Is it possible to do this (if possible, in a simple way) ?

Thanks a lot in advance.
RC99 & OM99

Hope the force will be with you !!!!!

Hello,

We plan to design  a robot which has to move very quicly and very
accurately.
For this matter we wonder if it is necessary to use one handy board or
to link two handy boards to complete such a task.
(If we use 2 HB, one (the slave) would be in charge of computing our
position (encoders and infrared beacons), driving our motors,and
processing all the data comming from our sensors (mainly bump
sensors).The other would receive from the previous all the positions of
the objects on the field (our robot, opponent's robot, obstacles) and
according to our strategy choose the best way to reach the goal (it's a
soccer robot contest).)

Maybe, some of you have alredy carried out such projects and can share
with us their experience.

Any advices to help us evaluating our HB needs would be appreciated.

Hi all,

As many people has requested me to send the code, I have decided to put it
on my microrobot projects page. Use it at your own risk! It is still in
development, but it can serve to show how to make the link. I have reused
code from many people, and so, they are credited in their source files.

Hello All,

I wish to program the Handy Board by plain machine code.

Does anyone know how to download a plain binary S19 code, using a 
standard serial terminal, communicating to the given IC monitor.
Also, how would I get the downloaded machine code to run.

In short ( I known this question must have been asked before ) is 
there the ability to communicate to the Handy Board, like Buffalo 
was able to communicate to the EVB boards.

Thanking you,

Can anyone clarify something for me?

A section of the code of sonar.asm goes as follows:

variable_sonar_time
sonar_time              FDB       0

What does this mean? Why are there two variables before the FDB?

Another section goes as follows:

variable_sonar_enable   FCB       0
sonar_enable            FCB       0

I thought IC integers had to be 2 bytes.
And also, are these two different variables?

Thanks for any help.   :)

The line "variable_sonar_time" indicates that the
immediately following FDB will be available to IC
as an integer variable named "sonar_time".

The next line with the FDB is just a regular
assembler definition statement to allocate storage
for the variable and name it for assembler access
purposes.

Yes, IC integers have to be 2 bytes.

> And also, are these two different variables?

My guess is "yes and no".  I am guessing they are
pulling a trick so that IC sees a 2-byte variable
while assembler sees a 1-byte variable.

I haven't seen this sort of thing before.  If you
didn't copy it wrong and if it really works then
my guess would be that it is defining a
single-byte value for assembler usage, prefixed by
a guaranteed null byte so that IC can access it
properly.

At the beginning of January, fifty 6.270 teams were given kits
containing a microcontroller board, sensors, Lego parts, and the rules
for this year's contest, "RoboGolf". With a basic knowledge of
robotics, taught by the contest's student organizers, the teams each
then set out to construct an autonomous robot. Three and a half weeks
later, those robots competed against each other at the twelfth annual
6.270 competition until a victor emerged.

This year, the contest organizers are making videotapes of the
competition available to the public with help from MIT Video
Productions and sponsorship from Oracle. The price of the videotapes
will be $20 per tape in the United States and $25 elsewhere. Note that
these prices represent the costs of production and shipping, and 6.270
does not intend to make a profit on the sales. All tapes are
high-quality VHS dubs and come in a stylish vinyl case.

Subject: Strange IC error

I have attached the HB to a formerly radio controled car.  I built an h
brigde as described on wizard.org to control the motor.  Anway.... all is
going well, I have written routines to control the motor.  Still sounds
great... Until I get to uploading them into the HB using IC 2.853-Rev2.  I
get a:
Fatal Internal Error
Illegal size to spew push-op

and then it shuts down.  I have never had this problem before and I don't
know what to do about it.  Are the upload files only allowed to be so big?
Here is the exact contents of the file I am trying to upload.  The variable
'motor' is the number of the motor output of the HB which my steering motor
is connected to.  I have connected the reverse and forward control wires of
the HB to SCK and MOSI.

void fd_left(int on, int off, int motor,int turnlen)
{
	turn(on,off,motor,turnlen, -1,1);
}

void fd_right(int on, int off, int motor,int turnlen)
{
	turn(on,off,motor,turnlen, 1,1);
}

Subject: LCD help
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I have build the board described in my book "Mobile Robots" which is a
great book. I just got the board going after realizing it isn't a good
idea to
assume the pin outs of all 32K x 8 ram chips is standardized  :)

I was hoping someone could help with my current problem, wiring this 20
x 2 LCD screen to the board. Its a standard HD44780 controller but no
matter what base software I
load using Interactive C, the display shows nothing. By nothing I mean
no data, the LCD does turn on and you see the little black squares.  I
have checked my wiring about 50 times and the LCD is fine because I can
use it with PIC's and my basic stamp 2 processor. I use the 74HC10 as
described in my book rather than the 74hc132 and after looking at the
handy board schematics I don't think the LCD would be affected by this.
I have also tried using the rug warrior code (pcoderwl.s19 and
pcode_rw.s19) and those don't work either. When I run IC I can type 1+2;

and the board will respond with 3 so I know the board is working and
everything seems to be fine except that I get nothing on the LCD. The
LCD that I am using is a 20 x 2 Hitachi display. I am using the
68hc11A0FN fitted into a botboard which is then wired to a breadboard
with the ram and LCD.

Thanks

Hello everyone!  I was wondering why my IC compiler ( IC-2.853Rev2 )
keeps giving me wacky and excessivly silly errors.  Are there libraries
that I was supposed to download to get rid of those pesky start_button and
start_press undefined error statements.  If there is an ftp site for these
libraries, that would be great. I looked around the cher.media.mit.edu one
and didnt see there.  If anyone could help me out with this, that would be
great.  Apparently programs that run on other peoples handyboard dont want
to compile for mine and thats when i get the error message.

Thanks!

Never mind... I discovered that IC didn't like me using a variable for the
8 bits to pass to bit_set and bit_clear (too bad it didn't just tell me
that instead of throwing its arms up and quiting).   I wanted to use the
variable to save code space, but alas I changed the code to an if statement
and two while loops.

The code that defines these and other useful functions is called lib_hb.c,
and versions of it can be found on the Handy Board web site (e.g., the most
excellent version that includes smooth pulse-width modulation for the motors).

Marie, I tried to send you a message from work to the address

German Gentile--

I know nothing about Imagecraft C, but here's how the beep function is
defined in lib_hb.c (the Interactive C library of functions written for the
Handy Board):

void beep()
{
    tone(500., .1);
}

/*  1/2 cycle delay in .5us goes in 0x26 and 0x27  */ 
void tone(float frequency, float length)
{
    set_beeper_pitch(frequency);
    beeper_on();
    sleep(length);
    beeper_off();
}

void beeper_on()
{
    bit_set(0x1020, 0b00000001);
    bit_set(0x1022, 0b00001000);
}

void beeper_off()
{
    bit_clear(0x1022, 0b00001000);
    bit_clear(0x1020, 0b00000001);
    bit_clear(0x1000, 0b00001000);	/* turn power to spkr off */
}

void set_beeper_pitch(float frequency)
{
    pokeword(0x26, (int)(1E6 / frequency));
}    

If Imagecraft C has poke and bit manipulation functions, then you ought to
be able to translate this directly.  Good luck.

Howdy all,

I finally attached an infrared reflectance sensor to my handyboard and it 
works! With my non-existent electronic experiences I managed to solder a 
resistance (330 ohms) to a three-legged sensor similar to the four-legged 
variant mentioned in the FAQ.

So I ordered IC 3.2 and received a registration key the following day (good 
work Newton) and started setting up the project for my LARVE (Little 
Autonomous Robot VEhicle). I used to be an administrative programmer in 
dBase and Clipper 87 but am new to C and have to rely on the excellent book 
"The C Programming Language" from Kernighan/Ritchie (Prentice-Hall).

I now come across the first two problems I just can't find a solution for 
myself,
I'm probably overseeing something or what?

-1- My robot has four drivewheels, each connected to a motor and a 
reflectance sensor. I want to use a data structure array to store all 
parameters, settings and readings for each wheel. The m/c routine creates a 
variable "encoder0_counts" while I want to use the structure element 
"wheel[i].encoder.count".

When I use pointers in the declarations of the encoder structure I also 
have to change the syntax of the routines to deference the pointers. This 
is NOT what I want.

	struct _wheel {int radius;int ticks;};
	struct _encoder {int port;int *velocity ;int *count;};
	struct drivewheel {struct _encoder encoder;struct _wheel   wheel;} 
wheel[4];

	wheel[0].encoder.count= &encoder0_counts;
	*wheel[0].encoder.count= 0;			/*I want to get rid of that dereferencing 
asterix ...*/
	
Is there a way I can declare "wheel.encoder.count" so that it exists as an 
integer pointing to the same memory location as "encoder0_counts"? Can I 
change the pointer of an existing integer?
"wheel[0].encoder.count= 0;" Would then be the same as "encoder0_counts= 
0;"

-2- I want to initialize an array "char readings[256]" to hold the 
measurements during calibration. But it leads to one of those well 
explained <lol> memory errors. Of course it can be declared globally but 
then it will take up space while only used when calibrating. Can I increase 
the stack size for a function without starting it as a seperate process? Or 
can I set TICKS to 1000 and will the process act as a normal function?



Can anyone be of help?

Thanks,

I was wondering if anyone has a good source for fairly high quality, low
cost gear motors that inteface well with the handy board. Right now i am
using a cheap little, current hungry 3v toy bulldozer as a platform. I
would love to find some nice little efficient brushless 9v gearhead
motors with encoders that i would not have to spend $200 apiece on!

If I am understanding you right...  I haven't looked at the encoder
routines yet, but I am assuming encoder0_counts is global.  Why not, just
omit the pointer count from the _encoder struct and just use the global,
since you already have it?  That aside, I'm don't know what you have
against '*' in having the statement *wheel[0].encoder.count = 0;  It
accomplishes what you want and that's going to be your only solution I
think.  I'm not too familiar with IC, but I am guessing it adhears fairly
closely to standard C in it's implementation.  You are wanting to use a
feature of C++, pass by reference.  Standard C doesn't support it.

void change_count(int& iamTheSaveVar)
{
	iamTheSaveVar=0;
}

int main()
{
	int somevar=1;
	change_count(somevar);
	return somevar;
}

in C++, this would effectively set somevar to 0, but I don't think that it
would work in IC, but I haven't tried it.  I would but I am online and I
only have on RS232 serial cable and it is connected to my modem right now
:)  The passing by reference is not any different that passing a pointer
and deferencing it.

> Can I change the pointer of an existing integer?

I'm not quite sure what you mean by that.

Hi, thanks for your reply ...

Why don't I use the encoder0_counts variable ?

I want to create a multi-tasked environment with seperate processes for 
each wheel to calculate wheel speeds. The same code will be used to 
calculate speed for 4 wheels. What I realize now is that I can dereference 
the velocity variable when using it. I was (am) very focussed on creating a 
- simple - uniform structure describing the robot, without pointer 
references to simplify coding and prevent errors. So what I thought up was;

A memory location XXXX with contents AAAA is named "encoder0_velocity" when 
using the compiler / interpreter. It would be very convieniant if I could 
create a variable named "CurrentSpeed" using memory location XXXX as well. 
Then I could use both names in the compiler/interpreter - to create clean 
code - while actually describing one memory location containing AAAA.

Maybe I could change the MC routines to use a structure to return their 
value and recompile them to icb files? Just to clean up the code ? Or is 
this extreme knit picking?

   struct drivewheel wheel[4];

   void launch () {
      int i;
      for (i=0;i<4;i++)
         start_process( calculate_speed( i ) );
   }

   void calculate_speed( int index ) {
      wheel[i].motor.speed.average = ( wheel[i].motor.speed.average * 9 + 
wheel[i].motor.speed.current ) / 10;
      wheel[i].wheel.speed.current = *wheel[i].encoder.velocity * 1000 / 
64;
      wheel[i].wheel.speed.average = ( wheel[i].wheel.speed.average * 9 + 
wheel[i].wheel.speed.current ) / 10;
   }

I can't believe nowbody of the list users know how works the sound routines
in the handyboard???
Please, if any have idea of how i can implement that on OTHER C COMPILER
(don't interactive C), please anwser to my question.

P.D,: Remember , the interactive C works into the handy, and the beep(),
tone(), etc, interact with other process (that is what i don't know), that
functions (beep, tone, etc) alone don't do nothing.
Please don't send me mail saying : use beep().
Thanks again.

The components you're looking for sound exactly like ones that came with my
Lego Technic kit.  The actuator cylinders come in two sizes (the big one's
about the size you're looking for), and there's a compressor cylinder and
pressure reservoir available, too.  The only tricky part is that they don't
offer an electrically-operated air valve (that I know of).  You can purchase
most of the components individually, including air hoses, T fittings, and
valves.  You can get a catalog by calling Lego Shop-At-Home (1-800-453-4652).

I know I'm starting to sound like a frothing-at-the-mouth Lego fanatic, but
really they do make very high quality parts, precision-formed from virtually
indestructable nylon.  They can be sort of expensive, and try to avoid
buying Legos from Dacta/Pitsco if you can help it, because they often have
even higher prices than Lego Shop-At-Home.

Check out Herbach and Rademan at www.herbach.com for surplus DC gearhead
motors.  They often have 6-24  volt, optically encoded motors for $20-$25
each.

Small pneumatics are tough because commercial actuators are (A) expensive
and (B)they assume a stationary machine tied to "shop air", i.e. miniature
mobile compressors/regulators/receivers are nonexistant.

HOWEVER; you still have 3 good possibilities:

1. Tower Hobbies (I don't have their address 'cause I'm at work, but will
send it if you need) or any large RC aircraft hobby store will have a supply
of actuators, control valves, regulators, sequencers, etc. for pneumatic
landing gear.  This stuff has the added advantage of already being designed
for RC servo control, so running it with the HandyBoard is relatively
simple.  RC aircraft pneumatic systems use standard PEET plastic soda pop
bottles for air receivers.  You charge the receiver with a tire pump; don't
worry, these bottles will hold 50PSI safely (actually, 200PSI proof, but
don't try it).

2.  Lego pneumatics are surprisingly capable, although their pump doesn't
make much volume.  You can control the valves with RC servos, or more simply
by using very small solenoids; which ARE hard to find, but if you prowl the
electronics surplus markets you will turn up some cuties.  BTW Will, Lego is
made almost exclusively from ABS.

3. fischertechnik has made a pneumatics line for years, in fact the Lego
pneumatic stuff is er... "patterned" on the ft stuff.  The ft pump is
larger, but the valves in the recent sets are simple 3-way deals, like Lego.
Earlier ft pneumatics sets had much sexier valves and elaborate sequenceing
cababilities.  These may still be available as parts, but I havn't checked
recently.

        The problem with both Lego and ft is that there is no control on the
supply pressure, i.e. the pump runs all the time.  So when you're not
actuating, the drive belt slips and the motor runs near stall.  This just
EATS batteries and belts.  I made a receiver from a small shampoo bottle and
devised a simple pressure switch to control my pump, and it works fine.  I
use fischertechnik, but the same sort of thing should be doable with Lego.

Hi German, I sent this to you before, but I guess you didn't keep
it.

This one is going to both the robot-board and handyboard lists
you can always find it again later by searching the archives for
these lists.

To beep the beeper using ImageCraft C you will need to set up
three
things, 
	-- Two global values, one containing the beep period, and
	   the other containing the beep duration. These should be
	   unsigned 16 bit values.
	-- an interrupt service routine for the OC5 timer, that checks
	   the duration value and if it is not zero loads the period
	   value into the OC5 counter and starts it, then decrements
	   the duration counter.
	-- A C function that takes a frequency and period and
           converts them into a pair of period and duration
values.
	   stores the global values and starts the OC5 counter for
	   the first time.

If you don't set up the OC5 interrupt routine in your crt11.s
file you should store in the new values in your main() function.
Remember that the interrupt vector table on the handboard is at
0xbfe0 (check that with the pink book, i'm using it from memory
and I do drop bits now and then).

I have a few problems with the Handyboard I just put together:

1. I lose contact with the board from IC very often. Then, when I try to
reset the board it will not always reboot. One of the following usually
happens:

a) I just get the single line of black squares on the LCD.
b) I get part of the IC boot message, then it freezes.
c) I get the complete startup IC-message, then it freezes (probably a
   special case of b).

2. When I try to load the battery, the Charge LED lights up and slowly
fades away. This applies to both charging using the serial interface card,
and using the connector on the HB itself. This seems to happen only the
first time I charge after some time. (After a day away from the HB,
typically.) If I try to charge just after this "fading" has happened, the 
LED just stays dark.


And a last question:

Is a bad idea to run the HandyBoard without the L293's and the ZTX614 ?
(That is just what I'm doing, since I haven't gotten hold of these parts
yet.) I can't think of it as beeing harmful to the HB, as long as I dont
try to use any of them, at least. Or is it?

Hello everyone.  I finally got everything cool with the Handyboard I'm
using in terms of the software and loading it and getting all connections
right.  The only problem now is that the motors on my little robot pretty
much stop after maybe 45 seconds of operation.  The motor lights do what
they are supposed to but they blink.  Im assuming this is a battery issue.
Is there any way to boost the power tot he motors so that they will run
for at least half an hour without killing the handyboard? Should I just go
looking for something with smaller motors?  The ones im using are just the
standard little ones.  If you guys know anything, I'de appreciate that.

Also..I watched Robots Rising on the discovery channel. Cool stuff...
Has any out there doing any thing with analog robotics using only
transistors and the like?

Thanks!
Richard

Perhaps your motors draw too much current. You can only draw 600mA from
the L293D driver IC. In the HB manual, you can see you can draw 1A from a
IC from TI. (I don't know the exact number right now).
You could try to use a seperate IC for each motor, if you only have two
motors running at once (eg. only use motor 0/1 and motor 2/3
simultaniously.) If your L293D's get really hot, this might be a solution.

I saw an other program Discovery some time ago, in which a guy had build a
zoo of robots, all build from old Walkmans and only containing a couple of
transistors. They did walk, and the guy who build them, said they adepted
to their environment, but I found that hard to believe.

Perhaps the problem is your motor-drivers IC's. If you use the L293D or
something, which are standard on the HandyBoard, you can only draw abou
600 mA. I use the other ones mentioned in the HB manual (they're from
Texas Intr., but I can't remember the number right now), which allow you
to draw up to 1A. If you drivers IC get hot, this could be the problem.
If you only use 2 motors, you could also try to use different driver IC
for both (e.g. use only 'motor 0/1' and 'motor 2/3').

I saw a program on robotics a while ago on Discovery, and there was a guy  
who builded a complete zoo of robots consisting of only a couple of
transistors. They did move indeed, but he said they were adapting to their  
environment, which I find hard to believe.

Can you translate this into "EE for dummies?".
I slowly start to grasp some of the idea about 
voltage dividers but still don't understand. 
Won't this setup drain the battery? How does
one calculate and wire such a thing - in this
particular case?

I ask this because I want to use a lead battery
for my lego robot, not only do I have such a 
battery already :) but I understood that the 
characteristics of these things tend to be a 
more gentle curve towards the LOW battery 
situation and thus better measurable.

(Opposed to NICADs steep curve from 1.2 to
0 point something very quickly)

Help would be appreciated!

Sure:
Solder a wire to the "BATTERY +", add 2 resistors to make a voltage divider
(to divide the battery ABSOLUTE MAX condition, say about 12V, down to about
4 volts for the analog 0-5v range), and feed it into an ANALOG input point.
 Put a multimeter on the battery to measure its volts in a LOW charge
condition, and then in a HIGH charge condition.  Read the HB analog input
value for both those conditions, and assume a linear connection between bat
volts and analog reading.
Pity it wasn't built in!

I think it was the crazy guys in Austin (the ones that put on
Robofest) that had a 'portable' air reservoir that consisted of a
2 liter coke bottle, a relief pressure valve and tubing. The coke
bottle was filled about a third of the way with water, and then
dry ice chips were dropped into the bottle and the bottle was
then capped. The valve ran at something like 150 - 175psi if I
recall. And as long as you had ice you had plenty of pressure. I
believe they had plans for a self reloading version. (spring
loaded dry ice pellets) but I don't know if it was ever built.

I never say imagecraft C can't use peek and poke???? I can see, you don't
understand my  mail. Wich i see is : make beep the handy is not simply put a
byte in a place into the memory, no way. you have to write a interrupt
routine , and do adiitional work . Your large explications over that
question sound well , but is not really true. Chuck Mcmanis send me a e-mail
explaining to me how to make beep the handy, i reply that for you so you
will know how it wotk really.
Anyway thanks for your time. Ah, yes i'm live in Argentina and where you
from?.

According to my measurements, the flat flex cable that comes with the
Polaroid kits is 1.25 mm (or 0.05"), so it would probably not be quite
compatible with the parts that Digikey offers.  I looked exhaustively
through the Digikey offerings, but only found 0.1" and 1 mm flat flex
components.  The only places I've seen the 1.25 mm series are on the Burndy
web site (www.burndy.com) and the Molex web site (www.molex.com), but these
two companies just make the parts--they don't sell 'em as far as I know.

Since finding out that the connectors aren't really plugs but board
connectors instead, I've decided to find someone to sell me a couple more
Burndy SLP9S-2's (or equivalent) and some flat flex jumpers without the
connectors on the ends.  That way, I can still have the modular connections
that I want without having to modify the components that are on loan to me.
I'll continue to document my progress, for the benefit of the few who follow
in my footsteps, and for the annoyance of those who couldn't care less ;)

sure, it will drain the battery, but if it's a low enough drain, you don't
have to worry about it.  for example if you have a 10 amp-hour battery,
drawing .5 mA would take something like 830 days to drain it.  I wouldn't
worry too much.
to calculate the values, just assume a current drain and pick a max
(battery charged) voltage and insert your battery voltage into ohms law 
(E=I/R)  andout pops your resistor values:

(example)  you have a 12 volt battery, you want to have a current drain of
.5 mA and you picked 4.5 volts as your 'fully charged' reading.

12-4.5=7.5
7.5/.0005=15000  so R1=15K
4.5/.0005=9000    so R2=9K

wiring:
connect one end of R1 to the positive term of the battery.  connect the
other end of R1 to one end of R2.  connect the other end of R2 to the
battery ground.  connect the junction of R1 and R2 to an analog input of
the HB.

read the value at the analog input while you have your battery discharged
to the point at which you want some action to be taken.

program your robot to take the action when that analog input goes below the
value determined in the previous step.

I've built a few of his machines myself.  The "Neural Net" is a 74ls244 
set up as a shift register with RC networks between each stage.  The 
walkers go forward ok, but can't turn or back up.  Mark Tilden's very 
talented at mechanical design, though!

It is clear to me that if i even attempted any work with construction and
installation of a H Bridge for my handyboard it would be left a blackened,
smoldering wreck.   So this is my question.....is there any where to get a
preassembled H-bridge from somewhere?  

I looked over the schematics and was pretty confused.

Hello,

I am also searching for a preassembled H-Bridge (12 Volt max 10 Amp in
continuous mode).
If anyone knows a good place to order one, I would be very interested.
(We already tried to build the H-Bridge from Chuck Mac Manis but its
components don't exist in France or are too expensive)

Thanks

Ah, that takes me back a bit. I built one in the late 60's
from plans in Practical Electronics, used about 40
transistors and mechano bits. Its collision avoidance sensor
was based around an OCP71 photo transistor mounted in an old
Pifco torch reflector. It wandered around on its little
motors and avoided bumping into things. Robotics has
certainly come a long way in the last 30 years hasn't it?
    Or if you want to go back even further check out Grey
Walter's Turtles, circa 1950, a couple of valves (tubes to you
transatlantic types) and they demonstrated primitive behaviours.

=09Hello Fran=E7ois, HandyBoard group,

=09We had a similar problem when we tried using an R/C model
=09as a mobile base platform for our robot.
=09Searching the net turned up the LMD18200 (3A, 55V H-Bridge)
=09from National Semiconductors, which was suitable for our
=09needs
=09=09 (http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LMD18200.html).

=09It can be ordered from Wirz Electronics
=09=09(http://wirz.com/motor/board.html)

=09I believe that the 10A continuous mode you require would
=09increase the size of the component considerably. Do you
=09have size/weight restrictions?

The defer function is used in multithreaded programs when one process
doesn't require all the processor cycles that it would ordinarily be allotted.

Typically, if you have multiple processes (threads, tasks, whatever) running
at the same time, the system ordinarily cycles through them one at a time,
giving each one a few clock cycles (I believe the default is five).  If you
have one thread that doesn't require many cycles, and you know that it can
afford to wait 'til its next turn in the sequence before it needs to do more
work, then you defer that thread, and in that way it politely relinquishes
the rest of its turn to whichever process comes next.  It can be thought of
as a way to lower the priority of a particular process; a similar effect
could be obtained by specifying fewer than the default number of cycles to a
process when you create it (see the HB Tech. Reference for the exact syntax
of process creation).

Here's an example:  Say you have three processes--A, B & C--and you create B
such that it gets 10 cycles per turn, and C such that it gets 20 cycles per
turn.  Process A gets the default 5 cycles per turn.  Now suppose that the
code in process B performs a test, and if the test comes up negative (which
happens, say, about half the time) the process defers itself after only five
cycles, and if it comes up positive, it defers after nine cycles.  In that
case, you might get the following allotment of CPU cycles:

A     B     C
----  ----  ----
5     9     20
5     5     20
5     5     20
5     9     20
5     9     20
5     5     20

So the result in this example is that process B never actually uses its
whole ten cycles each time it has its turn.  Now this is an artificial
example in that most processes will probably require more than nine cycles
to do a useful test and accomplish anything, but by making B defer, the
other processes don't have to wait quite so long, which can make the program
as a whole run more efficiently.

Hope that answers your question, and if I'm wrong about any of this, I hope
someone else posts a correction.  Good luck.

This suggestion isn't even close to what you require, but it may meet
the needs of others on the list who are looking for an alternative
H-bridge:

http://www.solutions-cubed.com/Products/Motormind%20B/mmb.htm

It can go to 3.5A at 35vdc, and is serially controlled.  I don't think
it would be hard to build a pic interface to the HB if serial control
was ineffective for some reason.

Thanks everyone..Ill check those out.  Im probably not going to do
anything that requires soldering things on the handy board.  Unfortunatly,
im only borrowing this one.  I'll just see if i can borrow a rover with
less power hungry motors from the university.
      I think that getting smaller motors is about the last obstacle with
our project on building an autonomous robot.  Everything works great on
the handyboard and sensor end of thing and I goofed around for an hour or
so getting it to play the theme from the pink panther, looney tunes, or
nothing at all depending on the  inputs from the knob.  
This should go over well.  The project has to be done in about 3 weeks and
in about a month is this huge expo with all the different high schools.
Robots impress people. I think we have good chances.

Hi
talking about the H-Bridge.....we are building one here for a 1.5 kW moto=
r
with maximal power output of 2.2 kW.
This one works with 400V but is also developped for a current of a little=

more than 10 A (actually 15A).  It will be chopped with a frequency of up=

to 25kHz.
The main problem is not the voltage, it's the current and the frequency.
Switching high currents fast means that you will get switching loses.
All I wanna say is that you have to be careful.  H-Bridges aren't that
easy to build and if bought for industrial purposes pretty expansive. I
don't think that there is an integrated 10A H-Bridge.  I've found some 3A=

Bridges but they are really hard to get.

Question : Does it have to be 10 A ????

If yes, you could use two or three 3A Bridges parallel. That's what we
have done here for a robot.
Try NS for those H.Bridges.

Easy solution.

Why waste so much time looking for connectors.
Just remove the connector and solder some wires to the board and run those
wires to whatever kind of connector you want!

Hey! I was wondering if anyone has written any sort of fairly simple
program that can detect another handyboard by using the IR input sensor.
Does this require anything else besides maybe an analog IR sensor and the
sensor on the board?
If you could help me out, that would be great!

Hello,

First thanks for your answers regarding H-Bridges and especially the
LM18200.
This H-Bridges would be used with 12V DC motors which can sink up to
12Amp each and I have plenty of room to put them.
But there is still something that puzle me :
In the datasheet they said that the LM18200 is rated for 12V to 55V.
Why not from 0V to 55V?. I mean if I want to slow my motor, the power
apllied will have to decrease  step by step to 0V.
In my case I want to use the LMD18200 to drive a 12DC with a power suply
evolving between 0 and12V by 0.1V steps.

Thanks/Danke

Fran=E7ois

Its a MOSFET based bridge, the Vgs potential needed to put the
FETs into full enhancement mode is 11.2v or thereabouts. At lower
voltages the FETs operate in their linear range (their Rds value
goes up) and they dissipate much more heat. (As Rds goes up, I2R
losses go up as well)

Hello,
I am exploring the possibility of using the handyboard as a trigger for
scripted macros on the mac. I know there exist different external modules
that can be used for sound mixing, video control, etc, that is either
connected to the mac through the adb port or using midi.
What I=B4m looking for is a program that can convert midi input (from the
handyboard) to scriptable functions(Applescript/OneClick/Quickeys etc.) in
the MacOS or different applications.

Thanks,
Hans Christian Gilje

Hello,
I was wondering whether it would be difficult to connect a handyboard with
a palmpilot (http://palm.3com.com/home.html). They both have serialports
and both can be connected to a mac or pc.
It could be interesting to be able to trigger external devices by using the
palmpilot and handyboard.
Unfortunately my technical knowledge isn=B4t sufficient to see if this would
be a lot of work to make it possible, or if it=B4s a simple programming task=
=2E
There are written terminal emulator programs and VISCA controller software
for the Palmpilot, so I see some interesting uses for it if it can also be
made to work with the handyboard.

Thanks,

Hello,

Like Hans Christian Gilje I am interested if anybody tried to connect a
Psion (3A) to the handyboard?
Also I want to ask if someone can hand me some ideas about
troubleshooting the sonar 6500, it gives strange random values, and yes
I did place the 0.1 uF capacitor.
That is, I put a square shaped one in it, not a round one.
There is this text on it:  .1m100
Would that be ok ?
Does it matter how you place these kind of capacitors (- , +) ?

Thanks,

Jan Luijk.

I did a little research through the multitude of web sites devoted to BEAM
robotics (Biology, Electronics, Aesthetics & Mechanics).

It turns out that what they mean by "adapting to their environment" is that
these insect-like walking robots automatically adjust their stride to
different types of terrain (e.g. sand versus rock, or uphill versus
downhill).  Because they use simple analog electronic "nervous systems",
they automatically get feedback from the leg motors to dynamically change
the time domain response of the system, thus providing a robust, adaptable
walking gait.

Even HB 'bot builders like us could use this type of circuit to our
advantage.  By building dedicated nervous net circuits, we can free up our
HBs for high-level, brain-type functions.  This is how biological systems
are designed, and a billion years of evolution can't be wrong.

For an excellent tutorial on how to build and use this patented motor driver
circuit (called a MicroCore), check out the following site:

Could someone please explain to an electronics bonehead like myself the
following:

(1) What is meant by open collector (and what is the alternative)?

(2) How can I determine whether the Polaroid 6500 module ECHO output is open
collector (the IC is a TL851 PID614904 DIGITAL, if that helps)?

(3) What sort of signal contention might there be if it's not open
collector, and could the situation be remedied with a couple diodes, like this?

     module 1____|\|____
         ECHO    |/|    \
                diode    \________Handy Board

     module 2____|\|____/
         ECHO    |/|
                diode

(4) If the above boneheaded scheme were to work, what sort of diode would I use?

(5) Would there be any problem splitting the BINH signal to go two modules
like this?
                                   _______module 1
                                  /       BINH

I am trying to wire up my vector 2x compass and i had a question. It
looks as if everything is wired to the SPI port, however to actually
poll the compass you need to make p/c go low (pin 5 on the compass)

On the schematic it shows that i should connect this to 
U11 Pin 2 (motor controller), however i cant seem to find where this is
located on the handy board. Could one of you guys point me in the right
place?

Also if anyone has any suggestions of things to be aware of, let me
know. I would hate to fry a $50 part! :)

Thanks

Mike, 
U11  is the motor driver nearest the start button that drives motors 2 and
3.
The #2 pin  is the second pin back on the chip nearest the start button.
See page #2 of the Handyboard assembling manual.
I followed Tom Brusehaver instructions at the
handyboard/software/contrib/tomb/readme    Be carefull not to reverse any
wires and you will do just fine.
I have the v2x socketed on a pref board ,code loaded and the thing works
just fine. When I type at the IC prompt    v2x();  it constantly prints the
current heading.
My problem is not knowing enough about writing code.  I would like my bot
to go in one direction for a number of wheel rotations then
another-----ect.   I don't think  the compass is going to work very well
inside but should work fine outdoors.
 Please let me know when you when you get a workable code. If you could
share a working code I could change variables to suite my needs. 

				Good Luck
				Terry P. Gathright

OK...Im now pretty happy with states of things but I still have a few
questions I hope you can help me answer. The code attached works and
everything, but only when i take the bit about playing the songs out. 

problem 1)
 It
keeps saying that play is undefined.  I saw that before and fixed it by
changing the names of the labels of the songs.  I tried it this time and
it didnt work...i was wondering if anyone out there knows why it does this
and how to correct it....

problem 2)

I figured out (thanks to you guys) how to work the built in IR sensor to
detect and act upon 4 signals. One is for behing hostile, 3 is for
seeking, signal 5 is when it gets annoyed, and 7 it just beeps and ignores
it. 
The signal for being Hostile responds quickly and prints H on the screen
but the others lag and  i was wondering if you knew why this was.

-Richard

I've just been looking into BEAM robotics recently and it is very, very
interesting indeed.
Mark Tilden's claims may be hard to believe and it seems
counter-intuitive, but I think he has his head screwed on right and I
definitely reckon that the "bottom up" approach to AI is the only way
to go in the long run. You wanna check out some of his papers.. follow
some of these BEAM related links:

http://www2.xtdl.com/~bushbo/beam/main.html
http://www.golden.net/~amiller/
http://mh101.infi.net/~wtnewton/otherwld/

I can't wait to build one or two of these critters!

Subject: Help reading pulsewidth.
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi all.

Is there a way for me to read the pulsewidth comming out of a RC
receiver?  What I'm trying to do is to have an onboard Futaba R/C
receiver just in case my bot gets into trouble that it can't get out of
on it's own.  I want to use my HB controlled robot to inspect the pipes
under my house.  I would hate to have to go under the house to retrieve
it which is why I'm sending the robot in the first place.  I figure that
if I can read two channels of the receiver I could take direct control
if need be.  I  have the video transmitter and color video camera
pointing up at a 45 degree angle.  If I could read four channels I could
mount the camera on a pan and tilt platform and maybe use it as an
emersive VR system.

Thanks
Mike

yeah, I know what you mean... I have a TI-83 graphing calculator
(www.ti.com) and have been thinking the same thing.
Check up in your reference manual to see if it has anything on its
protocols. My TI calculator uses an easy send and recieve variables, and
also transmitts strings that you could store ahead of time.
So, basicaklly, see how it sends information and then write up code for t=
he
HB to interpret your PalmPilots signals

Sure.  Use an oscilloscope.

It seems to me that if you're looking to hook up the receiver to the HB,
couldn't you instead just run the receiver output through a capacitor to
smooth it out (and maybe a resistor to scale the voltage) and into an HB
analog port, so that instead of a variable PWM signal you're basically just
reading a variable DC voltage signal?  Keep in mind, though:  I'm an
electronic neophyte, and so anything I suggest should be taken with a grain
of salt about this big:

      |   typical grain dimension   |
      |<--------------------------->|
      |        (actual size)        |

I think it's great that you have a practical application for your robot
(inspecting the pipes under your house).  Mine's just another way to annoy
the cat, so far.  Always glad hear from those who are doing something useful
with their toys (like searching for land mines, etc.).  Good luck.

After sutdying the schmatics for an hour, I got up to get something to
drink.  When I came back I noticed that digital 1 is connected directly
to the IC 1 input line and digital 2 goes to IC2 via a pullup resistor.
It seems that the answer was right in front of my nose or something is
playing a cruel joke and switched manuals on me. :->  I think I get a
good accurate PW measurement through digital 1 providing that I set the
input registers correctly.  Am I correct in thinking this?  Replys, good
and bad are welcome.

Handy Boarders:

I cannot resist putting in a couple of plugs here for two good related
resources:

1) The 68HC11 Microcontroller by Joseph Greenfield. This comprehensive book
has a very nice section on reading/writing to I/O ports using timer output
compares with and without interrupts.  It starts pretty much from scratch
with lots of code segments included.  Check it out.

2) A Radio-Controlled Car and a 68HC11 Microprocessor by Dean Hoyt in
Circuit Cellar INK, Issue #78, January 1997.  This article describes how to
use a 68HC11 EVB to decode, read and store RC receiver pulses then replay
them later to duplicate paths.

By the way, Circuit Cellar INK is often a good resource for embedded micro
articles involving robots.  They have had numerous articles over the years
on stepper motors, robot navigation, servos, etc.  This month, #92 March,
there is an article by the Newton Labs folks on their Cognachrome robot
vision system and an article on robot power systems.

This must seem really elementary to everyone, but inside of my program,
how do i reset the value of the ir_data? I've been trying everything in
the handyboard technical references but it gives me either a syntax error
or  Cannot assign type <pointer to <function> >.

The cool thing is that you don't have to reset it; it resets itself
automatically.  When you call the function ir_data( 0 ), it returns the last
IR signal received, or zero if nothing has been received since the last time
you called it.

Hello All,

I am attempting to display characters on the Handy Board screen, 
using pure assembly.

I know the routine needs to be copied to internal RAM, put in single 
chip mode, then activate the display - as stated by the hardware 
reference manual.
But this documenation, (and any other documentation I could find for 
the Handy Board) does NOT adequately explain how to do it.

So I was hoping someone may have written an assembly / machine code 
routine that will display something on screen.
Hence provide code I can build from.

Thanking you,

Subject: Extending the HB memory... I know, I know...

I couldn't sleep so I thought I would make some use of my insomnia.

Several people have asked if the HB's memory can be extended, and usually
the answer is no, not if you want to run IC.  I have been taking a break
from my navigation systems, and been thinking about a SPI driven memory
extension.  I have 2, 128k SRAM chips, just lying here doing nothing so I
started wondering what it would take to build and write code to support the
device.  What I envision is a sort of harddrive for the HB.  Sure it's
slow, but to be able to dynamically load/unload stored programs or data not
always needed in main memory, it might be worth the trouble.  I was
thinking 4, 8 bit serial_in/parallel_out (HC164) strung together the memory
chips, and an 8 bit parallel in serial out(HC165).  18 bits necessary for
adressing 256k of memory, 8 for data to be written.  1 bit for read/write.
Am I leaving anything out? That still leaves 5 bits to either add a few
more bits to the addressing space for larger chunks of RAM, or control
plenty of stuff via the serial port.  The actual device _seems_ easy enough
to build, but the task of the software seems a little more daunting.  My
problem is I don't know much about how IC does it's memory management (I
guess that's what source code is for though), not much about memory
management in general.  I have a book on design of operating systems which
has some stuff about mem. man. but haven't really had chance to read it.
Does integrating this idea into IC seem riddled with problems, or does it
sound semi-reasonable?  I'm a CS major, so something like this would really
be educational. I'm not asking for help with the programming (at least not
yet), I am just trying to test the water before I jump in head first.

SO.... with all that said, if this message seems crazy, I'll blame it the
fact that I haven't slept in a long time.

Hi All,

A major problem, that has been the bain of my life for the last 3 
months. I am a third year undergraduate at the University of 
Sheffield, England, and for my dissertation I am undertaking a 
project entitled Autonomous Mobile Robotics. My aim in this project 
is to build a robot from a Fischertechnik kit, and control it with a 
6.270 board, with the aim being firstly to wall follow, and secondly 
to build a Self-Organising Neural Network representation of the 
environment.

Problem is the infra-red !! I have spent many weeks trying to get the 
robot to follow walls using infra-red, and various other methods, but 
to no avail !! The infra-red is too tempramental, or too sensitive to 
be of any use. Has anyone else had any experiences like myslef, that 
couold possibly help ??

Regards

Chris

Thanks All,

With the help you provided I think PipeBot will be a success.  It is
about to go on it's first test sortie under the house with an umbilical
and tether.  The umbilical is tied to three of the digital inputs so I
can take over control if nessesary.  There was a trade off in that I had
to lose the rear bump sensors to free up more inputs.  Has anybody had
any luck on using the expansion header and a 'hc374 for more inputs?  Is
the expansion board going to be released anytime soon?  Well the time is
comming to send my bot on it's way.

Again, thanks
Mike

 My aim in this project
is to build a robot from a Fischertechnik kit, and control it with a
6.270 board, with the aim being firstly to wall follow, and secondly
to build a Self-Organising Neural Network representation of the
environment.

Problem is the infra-red !! I have spent many weeks trying to get the
robot to follow walls using infra-red, and various other methods, but
to no avail !! The infra-red is too tempramental, or too sensitive to
be of any use. Has anyone else had any experiences like myslef, that
couold possibly help ??

Youre right. I/R is awfully finicky. Your best bet is to do it the way ants
do it: use feelers!
Take a sensitive microswitch (AKA Leaf Switch) and attatch a thin piece of
metal to protruse out as a 'feeler'. You have an easy digital input solution
that will result in a definite yes/no.

The best solution to the problem that I've seen is in the 6.270 Robot
Builder's Guide, which can be downloaded off of the documents page of the
Handy Board web site.  Fred Martin describes the bend sensors that were
developed for the Nintendo Power Glove.  They're used as variable resistance
feelers for very precise positioning from walls, etc.  Unfortunately, I
don't know where to buy them.  Maybe someone else on list could tell us
where we could buy these bend sensors?

I wrote a similar type scenario using a PIC (pre handyboard user)...
The trick I found was not to rely on a single return, but multiple.  That
is, use a counter, to count the number of hits.  Use 64 as a base number,
count down for each hit, up for a miss (always max 64)... You get the idea,
when the counter reaches 0, youre probably damn close to something....
I used 256, at 1ms between shots, left and right transmitters with a common
receiver (Mobile Robots, Inspiration.. Chapter 5), for the hardware design
and a lot of playing for the software.  I didn't move very fast about
1"/sec, so could afford the multiple hits.  Your mileage may vary.

I was wondering if anyone has used IR transmission in their programs and
if so, do you have a bit of simple sample code i could take a look at and
if you knew variable ranges or anything.

Also..does anyone know a common household material that will stop infrared
transmissions within a foot or so?  I built some shielding for the ir
reciever with some bits i cut from an AOL CDROm so it can localize where
the signal is coming from and go there.  
The problem is that its only good at insulating once you get outside of
this about 3ft. zone around it.

Aluminum foil will stop everything bigger than x-rays (and that includes
IR).  A CD looks highly reflective, but it probably refracts and reflects a
lot of energy, too.  I realize they don't send foil directly to your house
like they do those AOL CD-ROMs, but it's worth the extra trouble.

Hi,

After alot of replies to my wall following problem, loads of people 
have suggested bend sensors. Although I have considered these, I do 
not know where to get them in the UK, or any companies that ship them 
in the US.

Does anyone know of any companies either in the UK or the US that 
will do this ??

Thanks

Chris White

P.S. How much are they ??

==============================================


Hi Jaron,

I took the PCB off the battery case, and connected a wire to the +ve
terminal of the battery pack. Then I connected two resistors like this,
and brought the wires out, and plugged into the Analog5 connector:


      BAT --------R1---------*--------- Analog5 Input

      +ve        (10K)       |             (Active)

                            R2  (4K7)

                             |

                             *--------- Gnd (at Analog5

                                             Connector)


(There is an inbuilt 47K resistor from Analog5 Active to +5 in the HB
itself, but ignore that for the moment.)


I use the following code to read the battery voltage:


float bvolts(void)

/* BATTERY VOLTS MEASUREMENT - USES ANALOG 5 */

{

    return .1 * (float)   ((((analog(5)-17)*75)/57 + 2)/2) ;

}



int main()

{

    while (1)

        {

        printf("V =%f\n",bvolts());

        if (bvolts()>12.2)    /* 8 cells x 1.525V/cell  */

            beep();

        sleep(2.0);

        }

    return 0;

}


This program I leave running while the battery is charging, and the
beeper starts when the voltage gets too high.  For your purposes, you
will need a suitable test to check for falling volts as the battery goes
flat!


Why do I use such a complicated function to calculate BVOLTS() ? Because
it rounds off the result to 1 decimal place for me, and that is easier to
read on the LCD panel.  A simpler calculation is:

      <bigger>0.06579*(float)analog(5) - 1.0184

if no rounding is needed.  (Check the algebra of that, I think I got the
simplification right!)


In any case, the reading should be linear for different battery voltages,
and the "-1.0184" bit is a correction for the 47K inbuilt resistor on the
HB.


Will that flatten the battery?  Well I find the NiCd battery on its own
leaks away in a few weeks or so.  With the resistors added like above, it
flattens in a fortnight or two <<g>.  Let's look at a rough
calculation...  With 10K resistor, say it drains 1 mA, with 10 volts
across it.  What capacity NiCds? - say 600mAh.  Very roughly that gives
about 600 hours to drain all away - and 600 hours is about 3 or 4 weeks -
so that seems to add up.  


</bigger>Good luck

 Then it freezes up and the heart on the board stops.

At no stage has it come up with IC 3.1 on the LCD. 
The other one is working perfectly (so far)

I recently found a game which may interest some of you. You program your
robot using a simple Basic-like language and then let it loose against
other robots (only five allowed in the shareware version).
I haven't played it much yet but for the beginners in robotics out there
(I'm one of them) this could be a good way of learning basic artificial
intelligence.

Subject: Sonar HELP!
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Thu, 26 Mar 1998 16:39:35 EST

Anyone,
      Hi, I've hooked up a Polaroid 6500 sonar to my HandyBoard;
following the specifications in from the Hardware section in
the Handyboard homepage. I've also downloaded the sonar.c file
and downloaded onto the handyboard. Now here's the problem:
I ran sonar_init()
Then I ran sonar_sample() and I got a -1 as the result
So I ran sonar_display() and I still got the -1 ("******")
I did hear the clicking of the transducer. Now I looked through
that code and I think narrowed it down to the program not getting
an ECHO back and it timesout. I tried testing it off of objects from 
5" to about 18" away, and I still kept getting -1.
Can anyone help ?

Thanks in advance.
                                                 -CD

Subject: Ram peripheral cont.

Well, I put together something that works, and I now have 128k extra RAM
via the SPI, but I have a question about the ram chip... It is supplied by
the +5v that is on the SPI port right now.  The chip gets a fairly hot
after about 20min of having cont. power (it's the only one), but not
extremely hot, I didn't wait around for that.  The specs. on the ram chips
say 5.0v is the power supply voltage.   Should I have a resistor to lower
the current?  Sorry for my ignorance.

Subject: 68HC11 register locations?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'm writing an assembly routine under IC on the Handy Board, but I'm
getting a little confused about the memory locations of the 68HC11
registers.  The Motorola manual shows that the registers associated with
the input and output timers are in the $1000 range.  For instance,
TCTL1=$1020, TMSK1=$1022, TFLG1=$1023.  These definitions are also made
in the 6811regs.asm file supplied with IC, so everything seems
consistent.  If I look at the IC pcode source, however, I see that an
extra $1000 is added to these addresses.  This is done by loading $1000
into the X register (either directly or by using the #BASE symbol, which
is defined to be $1000), and then making all the address references
relative to the X register.  For instance,

	LDX	#BASE
	LDA	TMSK1,X
etc.

Which is the correct set of address locations?  When assembling the
version with the $1000 added I get a "Warning --- Value Truncated" for
each line uses the relative addressing.  Anyone have any ideas?  Why
does IC add an extra $1000?

  Thanks,

   - Mike

Richard:

I have a plethora of h-birdge circuit boards based on the L298 motor 
controller. ( My home company makes them, and I would be pleased to sell 
you the naked board or a kit with all the parts )

If you are interested in pricing, please conact me.

Wirz Electronics has 3 different types in kits

The correct actual addresses are indeed all in the
$10xx range.  When you index off either the X or Y
register, the offset value is only 8 bits, or 0 to
$FF.  This is why you're getting the warning
messages, the high order $1000 is being ignored.

You do not have to use the indexed method to
address the registers, these are all equivilent:

        LDA    #$1020
and
        LDX    #$1000
        LDA    $20,X
and
        LDX    #$1000
        LDA    $1020,X    <--- gives warning, high
order $1000 ignored.

The equates allow you to use either direct or
indexed addressing to get at the registers.  The
only reason for using the indexed method is to
save 1 byte on each such instruction.

Wait!

Sorry, I was confused!  I thought the HB originally battery was 7.2V.
Silly me.  :-/    Why didn't anyone correct me???

Well, you kinda caused the confusion though.  
You mean 7.2V vs. 9.6V?
or 8.4V vs. 9.6V?
...cuz 9.6V is the original eight 1.2V NiCd's in series.

Anyway, these are all lower that 9.6V. So, the answer is...
It may be kinda risky to do because... If the HB draws too much current or
the battery has been drained a little, the voltage will drop and the HB's
voltage regulator will drop bellow the threshold voltage and this will
reset the microprocessor.  Your 7.2V or 8.4V may work in the very
begginning of your battery life cycle, but you won't be able to last long.
The other hand is if you use an "infinite" power supply, you may be
able to get away with it.  But then you have to have a wire to your HB all
the time...or a really HUGE battery.  :)

this actually should be fine.  the characteristic of nicads is to have
a fairly level output voltage as they discharge, and then drop off
sharply when the power's all gone.

so it should be no problem.

I'm looking for a source, probably US based, for the Polaroid 6500
ranging kit and the Vector  2x compass. 

Does anyone know a source that sells both of the components. I'm trying
to save myself two seperate international airmail costs to New Zealand.
The source would need to allow web purchases.

Does any one have any alternate components that may be worth looking at?

Try Wirz Electronics for the sonar module.  Last I heard, they will sell you
a single unit for about $50, and I'm pretty sure you can order via the web.
Unfortunately, I don't think that they sell the V2X.  You can also get the
sonar module directly from Polaroid, but of course they don't sell the V2X
either.  Don't order the sonar from Mondotronics Robot Store, 'cause you'll
pay 50% more than you have to if you do!

Good luck.

Does Gleason Research still sell the non-assembled HB kits.  Because I

hello,

I'm having trouble downloading on my Dell 300mhz PII computer but for
some reason have no trouble downloading on my old 486dx2 though. I get a
"wrong port or board mode message" when I use the HBDL.exe software and
a "timeout on serial receive. 256 chars left to receive" on the dos
DL.exe software. I've ruled out any problems with the serial port
because other peripherals work fine on it.. and there's no problem with
the HB because it works fine on the 486.. I'm really stumped here.. any
ideas anyone? 
thanks

JK

I had a similar problem, and while I couldn't exactly fix it, I managed to
avoid it as follows:  I had a serial mouse on COM1 and the HB plugged into
COM2.  I could *not* download like this no matter what I tried.  So, on a
whim, I found a 9 to 25 pin adapter plug and swapped ports.  All of the
sudden, with the mouse on COM2 and the HB on COM1, everything worked fine.
I've heard of others having trouble with the HB on COM2 also, but so far
I've not heard an adequate explanation for this strange behavior.  I
sincerely hope that your problem is as easy to solve as mine was; it sounds
just about as exasperating.  Good luck.

--Will

PS--Do double check to verify that you're using the correct types of cables
(the one from the computer to the serial interface board and the one from
there to the HB).  There are two distinct wirings for each of these two
kinds of cable, and I can't keep 'em straight myself <:]  Check the
documentation and e-mail archives if you're not sure.

Subject: Cheap Sonar

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

A while back there was a discussion on cheap sonar. I was wondering if
anyone has tried the sonar device from this page
http://www.seattlerobotics.org/encoder/may97/sonar2.html . If someone has
tried it, could you tell me what you think of it, and if you ran into any
problems using it.

Also, I just put my house up for sale and the real estate agent used a
small sonar device ( AccuTape) to measure the rooms. She told me the cost
of the device was roughly $30-$40. Has anyone tried to use a device like
this for robotics. The device was very small. It was about the size of a
business card.


Thanks

seen some basic stamp based servo controllers that will handle 6 apiece
and are addressed serially, and these look like they will work well. Has
anyone on the list ever played with them?

I am currently using an MSCC11 from Novasoft with a program called
Servo16 (I actually think the version I am using is called something
different but the original program was Servo16). This can control up to
16 servos, the first 12 can be configured to run a 'walk' so that all
the handyboard has to do is send one command to the MSCC11 and then it
is free to do other things.

I haven't assembled the walker yet due to time limitations but I have
tried the servos connected to it and it runs fine.

I hope this is of help.

I have a couple of the original sonar modules made by Texas Instruments (I
think these are the ones the article is describing) and they work just like
the model 6500 ones that Polariod now sells. You can also get them from
http://wirz.com/

The connector on these TI sonar boards has a different pinout from the
current model 6500 but I was still able to get them to work with a Handy
Board. 

I don't think TI makes them anymore. These were bought back in 92-93.

Chris,

I got the same problems with the IR detection. I read somewhere that this
is a problem when you use IC and multi processes. The solution could be a
"hog_processor()" statement in the IR routine.

My question to you is. How will you solve the second problem a
Self-Organising Neural Network. Do you have any info on this i.e. what
algorithm can be used?

Thanks in regard,

Emiel Agema

I have had the same problems with my P133 desktop running W95.
Other stuff communicated fine through com1 but the HB would not work.
After I changed the setting for recive buffer and transmit buffer to the
lowest value possible (min) it worked fine.

May be this helps solving some problems.

Good luck,

  If Port "A" on my miniboard doesn't have +5v supplied do I have a hardware
problem or does this just need to be enabled in software?

Trying to get a white line counting interrupt routine going with an edge
detect on PA7.

Hey everyone!   This is this first time I've seen this suggestion for
getting the downloaders to work on fast machines.

Maybe other people who are having trouble can try this!

So problems with downloading could be related to the FIFO buffer? I don't
think a mouse port needs the FIFO buffer. Can Win95 or NT disable the FIFO
buffer when using the mouse driver on a certain com port?? I know that
Win95 can let you disable the buffer when you have a modem connected to it,
but is it effectively disabling the Fifo register? That could be why older
computer with UART chips lower than 16550 have better success downloading
with the handy board...

Anyway, maybe someone could try this: going through the control panel of
Win95/NT and look up if there's an option for disabling the FIFO buffer
with a standard com port (no modem attached to it) and then try to download
on the handy board. Don't forget that if you are using a modem on this port
too, and if the speed connection is higher than 9600 bauds, then you should
enable the fifo buffer so the computer can maximize the transfer speed
between the external modem and the UART.
