Hi,

	This is in addition to the message by Mr Hui Pak from the Hui Pak Robot
Store in Hong Kong. <And I got HB from him too...>

	In order for you to do a successful bootstrap downloading, press the "stop
button" and at the same time, switch the board on. You have to do this
everytime you disconnect all power from the board.

	Good Luck...

After not having used the handyboard for half a year I'm trying to get
it going again.
The problem is: when connected to the battery (but turned off and all
sensors and motors
are unplugged), it draws about 0.15 amps
After about a minute or two, it's even 0.6 amps, and the voltage
regulator on board gets really
hot.
The board doesn't seem very dusty or dirty, and half a year ago it was
working well.

Does anybody have an idea how to fix it?

Thanks in advance

I have read through the Nine rules you mailed me. Iam getting starting 
with my project. I have a question that can we use structures and Double 
dimensional arrays in Interactive C. If we can use what will be the 
syntax.

Thanking you,
yours sincerely,

Dear Madhusudan,

You have to buy the commercial version of IC to get these features.
See http://www.newtonlabs.com/ic/ for information.

BS (shahian),

I have written a Machine code programming system, that I use for the 
Handyboards, in the microprocessor classes I lecture at this 
university.

The Machine code programming system is similar to the Motorolla 
Buffalo Operating system for the EV and EV-U boards.

You can obtain a copy at:

http://132.234.46.5/programs/

The documentation is also at that site.

I do not have a miniboard, so I do not know if it will run on it.  
But it probably would.

I was wondering if anybody knows how data is transfered through the RJ 11
modem cable to the Handyboard (i.e. the pin layout). My intention is to use
this information to look for/ design a wireless link.
Also, I would like to know if anyone has used, or if it is possible to use,
the Infrared input/ output for this purpose.

Fred,

Thanks the Polaroid sensors work great.  But I'm having trouble getting =
the two Handy Boards to commicate using Randy's routiine for the 6.270 =
board.   I have one board print everything that it gets from the serial =
port.  And I have another transmitting. The only thing that happens is =
if I turn the transmitting one on while it is connected to the recieving =
one then it displays a number.  But it doesn't display the number that I =
told it to send.  Any info would be helpful.

Thanks, Peter

Hi everyone,
		
	I hope you all are happy with each and every of your HANDYBOARDS, because
I am not.

	I have just solved my RESET problem by changing the "tri-state bus
controller" 74hc244 chip, I can RESET my HB by switching it off first, then
on. This could be useful for those having the same problem as mine. And a
special thanks to Maz Rahm for his contribution.

	After the above problem solved, I decided to change the switches of the HB
to the ones I bought from electronic stores. The start and stop switch were
replaced by a normally-open switch, but alot bigger compared to the one
originally used.

	When the soldering of the switches were complete, I decided to check for
faults. When I switched it on, everything was OK...but when I wanted to get
to the bootstrap mode, I couldn't. Is it because of the new, bigger
switches. Please help. I have checked for anything that might possibly be
wrong, but to no avail. Can anyone help me...any suggestions would be
GREATLY appreciated.

Thousands of Thanks,
Syah

Hi all,

 I need to connect a 4x40 LCD to the Handy Board. The "daughter 
board"(*) seems to contain the HD44780 controller and a 2x16 LCD. 
Ideally, we'd like to remove only the 2x16 LCD and replace it with a 
4x40 LCD that supports the HD44780. Any suggestions on how to make
this change transparent to the system?

Ozan

*: don't have the manuals with me so I had to make my own 
terminology.

Dave,
    I have been doing radio communications between my HB and a remote sensor
but I am sure you could use the same radios for communicating with a PC at
up to 2400 bps. I have been using an Elsema transceiver coupled with an FSK
modem chip. Elsema's web page:
http://www.elsema.com/elsema.htm
They are an Australian company but they do export to the USA as well as
other countries. The radio's that I am using operate on 27.145Mhz which is
legal for unliscenced use at up to 1 watt EIRP here in Australia. I have
successfully achieved transmission over close to 2 kilometres(1.25
miles)line of sight, which is about what they claim they are capable of. Ask
if you need more specific help.
Joe Martin

Hi all,

Yeeee Haaaw!  I just got my HB in from Gleason Research Friday and started
figuring it out this weekend.  WOW!  What a blast!  It was worth eating peanut
butter sandwiches for 3 months to save up for!  ;-)  This is EXACTLY what I've
needed to get started.   

Thanks Fred and all others who designed this system and made it and IC
available to hobbiests!!!!  

I've just started playing around with programming and am now thinking of how
to attach some wheels to motors.  Here's my first Q, that I didn't find an
answer for yet.

I have these 2 unmarked motors that seem to work off a 9v battery.
They are unmarked, so I don't know what they are 'rated'.

Q: How can I tell if I can run them directly off the motor control line?

Thanks!
GDF.

Subject: Serial I/O again
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII



Greetings!

I need a "good" sample of how to do serial i/o between the Handy Board
and a host computer. The host computer I am intereested in is running
MACOS (8.X).

Here is the scenario:

- The HB has an IC program downloaded on it.
- The program runs on it for a while, collecting some data (in any array)
- From time to time, I would like to enter a mode in the program where
  - I reconnect the HB to the computer (via serial interface)
  - The program transmits the array on to the computer.

In my mind, I need two things:

- A program on the host that talks to the serial port and "and listens"
  for the data. When the data arrives, it captures it into its own internal
  data structure (on the host).
- A set of routines on the HB that transmit the data.

I have seen various ways of doing this on the HB (i..e transmit). However,
at the moment, I am clueless about what I need to do on the host computer's
program to access the serial port. Ideally, I would like to run a program
different from IC to do this (unless there is a built-in feature in IC that
enables this).

Thanks,

Deepak.

the "correct" way is to measure their resistance with an ohmmeter.  if
it's less than 5 ohms, it might be a problem.

the "other" way is to just plug them in and turn on the motor
outputs.  as long as you use full power (not any of the
software-reduced power modes), the chips have thermal protection
against overloading.

if the motor chips get so hot they'll burn you, that is bad.  if the
HB immediately resets and beeps when you try to turn on the motor,
that is also bad.

Hi all,

I have just got a set of blank P.C.B's from Douglas electronics and now
trying to get all the parts togrther
to build the Handy Board. I have managed to find all the parts from R.S.
components and Farnell Electronics
except for the 32Kbit SRAM and the MC68HC11A1FN. Does anybody know of any
equivelent part numbers
for the SRAM. Also i have found the 68HC11 chip from both above suppliers
but they are both marked 'SMT'
which i presume means surface mount. I know this may sound stupid but do the
SMT versions have the legs curled
under the chip body allowing them to fit into a 52 pin PLCC socket.

Please can anyone help!!


cheers Russ.....

The PLCC version of the 68HC11 is the one that you want. The part number
from R.S. is 265-853 and in the July 97 - October 97 catalog it cost
7.50 pounds + VAT. This price has no doubt increased but the stock
number should be correct.
The 32K RAM I found in Maplins (code UH40T price 4.99 pounds inc. VAT
this price was from about Feb 98).

If you have managed to get all the other parts from Farnell and R.S.
would it be possible to have a list of the parts with associated stock
numbers and prices.

I hope this helps.

Russ,

From your email address I assume your are looking for parts in the UK. 

SRAM - I don't have a Farnell catalog around but almost any 32Kx8 SRAM should work. RS part number: 311-007 Toshiba TC55257DPI, 265-465 NEC uPD43256.

68HC11 - The 68HC11A1FN is a surface mount PLCC package. It will fit in the 52 pin socket.

You should also be able to get these parts from Maplin.

Ok,

I feel real dumb.  I could have sworn I didn't see the answer to that last
question when I read the printed version of the docs I had.

Now, I found the answer at:
<<el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/Projects/hb/sensors/index.html>>

I guess I was scanning the text for reference to the plugins (Dnn). Anyway, I
see now how the middle one (+5v supply) is not used for a microswitch.

Does NO (Normally Open) mean that current is flowing (Logical 1?)?

Thanks.
Gerald

Thanks all for the motor tips!  

I've found the FAQ and the Mail List archives...so I shouldn't
be asking so many dumb questions.

However, since I've checked the FAQ and am have 45 minutes left doownloading
the Archives...I have another couple-a-questions ;-)

Q: I see the digital inputs.  Now, there are 3 plug-ins.  2 on the bottom, and
one on the other side of a series resistor.  In Fred's booklet, it says that
you can use these digital inputs for a microswitch, but it doesn't say where
to plug it in?

ok...Say I am going to plug in a microswitch into D12.  Do I plug it into the
bottom 2 or the top one and one of the bottom 2?  Which of the bottom 2?

I saw the schematic in the booklet...but it is much more difficult to read
than schematics I've seen before, as I can't tell where the plug-ins are in
the schematic.

Don't mean to seem like a whiner.  I'm just trying to figure out the
docs...and I'm not an expert schematic reader.

Thanks!
Gerald

Ok, after reading it for the nth time, I think I understand this statement
now:

<<The normally open case means that the sensor line is pulled high by the 47K
resistor on the Handy Board. The standard software for reading the state of a
switch interprets this logic high value as ``not pressed'' or false. When the
switch is closed, the sensor line is connected to ground, and the software
reads a logic low value, which is interpreted as ``pressed'' or true. >>

I've heard the term Pull-up resistor before and didn't understand it.  I've
only had 1 electronics course (yrs ago) and am just a little confused as to
which direction current is pulled, or how you pull current.  (+ to -?)

I'll stop talking now...and hit the books some more.  Sorry for the wasted
bandwidth!

Gerald.

The Handy Board Technical Reference (available for download from the HB
web site) shows exactly how to connect microswitches and other sensors
to the HB--complete with pictures.  It's full of useful information; I
recommend it highly.  Good luck!

hi, 
I'm doing a robot to navigate it to a destination that needed to avoid
obstacle collision
along the way. Besides, I intend to use 2 dc motor ( 12v ,0.9Nm, 310mA
rating) for the 2 wheels and include the encoder too. Should I use stepper
for such robot application ?
Which is easy to write the alogrithm ?

Moreover, My robot has to navigate with the boundary of 5metres square ? 

Please advice .

rgds,
chia

Hi Everybody,

Sorry for bugging you all, but I'm desperate for some help...

My graphics Display preferences got messed up, and reinstalling the graphics 
card driver is not fixing it...

Last night I downloaded and unzipped http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/Proj
ects/hb/software/ic2853r2.zip , but while I was reading the Readme.ic file, I 
saw the mention to the *.pif files, which prompt me to investigate the 
contents of one of those *.pif files...

So, I selected c:\ic\ic.pif, "right button clicked" it, selected "Open 
with...", selected "Notepad", and this is what happened next...

After selecting "Notepad" (for opening the file), and hitting enter, I got a 
black screen with something like a square white box (almost like a cursor, bit 
bigger, and "not blinking") on the top left corner of my screen... After that 
I tried "exit", but nothing happend (same black screen)... Did it again, and 
nothing... Hit "Esc, and nothing... Pressed "Ctrl+Alt+Del", and nothing too... 
Did it a few more times and still nothing... So I had to reset the machine...

After it came up, the standard windows graphics driver was installed... I 
tried to reconfigure, then reinstalling (from disk, and later dowloading a new 
driver from Number 9's web site) the correct driver for my graphics card, but 
somehow, windows keep using it's standard driver, and it's 640x480 
resolution...

The mentioned machine is a dual processor motherboard running one Pentium Pro 
200, with 128 Mb RAM, and an "Imagine 128 Series 2" graphics card from 
"Numbber 9". The OS is NT Server 4.0 with service pack 3. Please let me know 
if you need any extra system info...

Does anyone have any clue on what happened ? Does anybody know how to fix the 
problem ?

Any help will be greatly appreciatted...

Thank you in advance,

Andre Philippi.

Michael,
           I have tried to use the Elsema radios without the modem chips but
because 27Mhz is such a noisy frequency (at least here in Australia) I found
that I got way to much interference when interfacing directly to TTL. The
modem chips are really just tone encoder/decoder pairs and I still get some
interference when using them which must mean that the tones on which they
operate must occasionally be being received by the radios. As a result I
have had to slow my data rates down because I am using them in an
application where timing is critical, my app is nothing like RS-232. It may
be feasible to use them this way in other applications.

    Joe,

    I looked up both the ELSEMA radio link and the modem chips, and it looks
as though a wireless data link could be set up without a modem chip.  It
seems both the FMT2705 and R2705 can handle TTL level logic input and output
respectively.  Does this sound possible to you? Did you actually have to use
a modem chip for the receiver end at the handyboard?
    Thanks for the tips in the last mail, they were much appreciated

    Cheers.

Hi all,

I have nearly completed building my handy board and have come across a
couple of stepper motors that i would like to use
to drive my robot.

Motor spec's are  :-
2 Phase 6V 1.2A 1.8Deg step

Is there any way of interfacing the handy board to drives these things?
I realize i will probably need some external drive circuit to cope with the
current load. Has anyone got any designs to this?



Cheers Russ.......

Look up the datasheet for the SGS-Thomson L297, they have a complete circuit
diagram for a stepper motor driver there.

Hi Fred.  I enjoy the listserv, though I am a real novice and don't always
understand what is going on.  But, I am reading and learning.  I just found
out that you helped with the creation of the Legos Mindstorm robots, which
I have purchased two for my science classes.  Unfornuately, they only run
on Windows 95 and we are a MAC (God help us) school.  But, I am building a
couple of computers to run the Mindstorms, so in time, we should be up and
running.  I was wondering, how similar/dissimilar are the Mindstorms from
the handyboard?  Also, how is the new addition board coming along?
thanking you in advance

greetings everyone.

im building a digital oscilloscope (to use on a PC) for a project in 
school
but im running into trouble with the ADC im using because it says to use 
separate grounds and VCC for the digital and analogue parts, but 
browsing around i4ve seen designs that have a COMMON VCC and grounds, 
with some capacitors (for filtering noise i imagine)
if anyone who has worked with ADC4s (or digital oscilloscopes for that 
matter!) at high freqs (5-20 MHz) has any ideas or experiences that can 
help me please repply.
thanks

Dear HandBoard list's Members>

	I am using your Handy Board and I have some questions:

1) I have been trying to use the infrared subsystem. However, 
i have got some problems. First I load the "sony-ir.icb" and my 
single program which looks like this:

main()
{
...
  
   sony_init(1);
   while (1)
     if (cod=ir_data(999)!=0) 
	printf("Code from SONY remote control: %d\n",cod);
}

Next, when I run this program in the HB, it receives the signal from
the sony RC however, BUT it only receive yes or no 
(i mean: pressed or not pressed, 1 if pressed or nothing)
My question is: How can i get/receive  the specific code sent by the RC??
or what is wrong with my sample program??


2) Can i connect more then one infrared receiver?, if yes,
How?

3) The HB has special routines for conrolling ONE servo-motor.
If  i get more servo/motors, could i control them by using other
analog ports? if yes, How?.

4) The HB provides an infrared output, however, in the HB technical 
reference you say "the output circuit requires an external infrared LED"
(page 23). you mean that using the current facility is not enough to operate?
where should be the "external infrared LED" connected to? to same analog
port or is it more complicated??


Thank you,

John

I have done a lot of work in the area of infrared I/O for the Handyboard.

My software at http://WWW.CAM.ORG/~mdavies/HB/ir.htm will let you send and
recieve codes for a wide variety of remotes.

Hello All,

My handy board will not communicate with the host computer.
When I connect the phone cable the  charge  led#14 lights bright, and
resistor #r11 gets real hot.
 
I have a v2x compass on the robot and program already loaded and it works
ok.

Any help would be appreciated . 	

						            	Thanks in advance

you are using the wrong kind of RJ11 cable.  See the FAQ question

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/faq/index.html#rj11

under the heading "The R11 on my Interface/Charger board is smoking
hot and is turning black!  What is wrong?"

Always check the FAQ, there is a lot of good stuff in there,
Fred

Hi all,

	I am here to tell you that you should love your Handy Board for it to love
you and stop giving you problems... and I feel love is all
around...<smmmooooch...>juz kissed my HB...

	But alas, my HB has stopped lovin me...well, its not really that bad,
because it still works for me. Except that I have made myself 8 digital
outputs by using the 374 chip on-board and tapping the digital outputs of
the 374 for my project. This is my first 8 digital outputs. The next 8
digital outputs I decided to tap the wiring from the previous 374 chip to
another 374 chip on another board I made. But the clock of the second chip
I used Y0 of the expansion slot.

	The problem is; to manipulate the first 374 chip digital output, I knew
that address 0x0e is used. This is for range $7000-$7fff. What does these
mean anyway? And for me to manipulate the 2nd digital outputs from the
second 374 chip, what address should I use? And can anyone tell me what it
means by the range is $4000-$4fff.

	Thanking everybody in advance, thank you...
SYAH

Hoi,

I have been playing around with the Chuck McManis (Thanks!) code for the
HandyBoard. Everything compiled quite easily on my COSMIC compiler. (Isn't
there a small bug in the LCD driver, I had to remove an = sign). I have
(almost?) finished a more detailed port in which I re-placed the compiler
specific options and settings with the ones needed for COSMIC. I also
changed most integers to characters to save some cycles.

I use two shaft encoders to measure wheel velocity. I created a simple shaft
encoding routine which work fine but implement the 32 cycle wait before
accessing the appropriate result registers. Since this routine runs 1000 Hz
for 2 encoders this implies a waste of 32 * 2 * 1000 = 64000 cycles.

Reading the pink book (chapter 12 page 14) I found the continues scan mode.
Wouldn't it be much faster to use this for the shaft encoding routines? I
will lose the 64000 cycle wait since the registers can then be expected to
carry the most recent value. The cost is that there are only 4 analog inputs
continuously read but while moving the robot it won't use more anyway. By
carefully arranging the sensors it will not be a problem. Otherwise I might
just write an interrupt-routine to change the scanned registers every so
often and store the results in 8 variables representing the analog ports.

Has anybody experiences with this (continues scanning mode)? Is somebody
good in quickly estimating the amount of cycles needed for one or both
option(s) and say if the idea is crap?

If there is an interest in the ported (or other) code let me know...

Groetjes, Jaron Paludanus

Howdy Fred and all others,

I still enjoy the HandyBoard mailing-list a lot.
So much that I would like some easier way to use it. 
Is there a reason this group is not on a news server (too)?
In my humble opinion this would allow faster responses.
And with it strengthen the bond between handyboarders worldwide.
At the cost of flames and spam though.

Groetjes,
Jaron Paludanus,

Hi all,

I'm looking for a recommendation on a LEGO set to buy for use with my Handy Board. I'm looking for a set with a reasonable number of pieces, gears, wheel and stuff to build a simple robot. I already have some motors and micro switches, I just need to build a chassis to support my "creation".

Also, how do you interface a random DC motor with the LEGO gears? Can I just take one small gear and glue/epoxy it in place on the motor output? Is there another trick I should know about? (Sorry for the stupid questions, but I've never played/used LEGO before, unless you count playing DUPLO with the kids...) 

What set are you using?

Thanks,
-- Eric

Won't a news group boost the volume a bit?
I sometimes have to wait 2 days before seeing my own message appear in de
list...
Which does not tempt to use it a lot.

Subject: Inconsistent startup

I'm trying to get a minimal 68hc11 board to run in single chip mode. After
I download the code and switch to run mode, pushing reset works fine. The
problem is when a startup in run mode, this Line of text comes up in my
terminal emulator. "BUFFALO 3.2 (int) - Bit User Fast Friendly Aid To
Logical Operation" It usually takes 3 resets to get my program to run. How
do I get the MCU to run my program at startup?

One other Question. What directive do I need to use for the as11 assembler
to recognize values as data and not generate an error?

Thanks.

Unless Fred knows any different and 2 days is an accurate time I would
suggest changing your ISP as I have always received the mailing list
copy of any messages that I have sent within 30 minutes of being sent.

Also a news group would require this part of internet access whereas
most people have access to email (mine is at work so reading emails is
allowed but internet access is restricted) not every body would want to
or be able to access a news group. So in my opinion the mailing list is
better, and we hardly ever get junk mail (I don't remember seeing any
within the last year).

John

Fred,

I agree...There is no need to go to a newsgroup.  I prefer the mailing list.
Here are some reasons why:

1) No spam!   Yeah!!!!
2) You don't get alot of lurkers who occasionally spout off just to critisize
(sp?) someone's difficulty with the english language or other un-related
issues.
3) These messages tend to stay Very focused.
4) Fred has alot of control over the list users (to keep out blatently
commercial hawkers, the bad ones anyway...)
5) the list is easier for me to get on than a newsgroup.  If there is a
newsgroup that I want, and it isn't already in the newsgroup list, I have to
ask my ISP to add it and it often takes a Loooooong time till I get access.
6) With a decent email program (Try Eudora Pro), you can get all these
messages saved into a certain folder.
7) This list was started by Fred and he is nice enough to be answering
questions.  So, he can do it whichever way he feels most comfortable. It's his
show.

Jaron,

No offense taken here...I was just voting my support for Fred, no matter what
he wants to do.  I think he is an incredibly generous guy to answer my dumb
newbie questions. :)

I also subscribe to several newsgroups for hypothisizing (sp?):
comp.arch.embedded
comp.robotics.misc
sci.electronics.design
sci.engr.control

hope this helps,
Gerald.

The junk mail part is true, but I'm not sure how true it is that you need
Internet access to read newsgroup. You see, the dialup is regulated by a
server computer. This computer has different accessible ports. One of them
is the email port. Another one is the news port, which is port 119. So,
any thing with an email port should have a news port. Then news reader
does NOT do any transfer like HTTP (which would be internet). Rather, it
acts like an email client and connects to the server the same way an email
program does, just on a diffrent port. Heck, I think that even the
protocols are similar!

> I'm looking for a recommendation on a LEGO set to buy for use with my Handy Board. I'm looking for a set with a reasonable number of pieces, gears, wheel and stuff to build a simple robot. I already have some motors and micro switches, I just need to build a chassis to support my "creation".

Looking through the Lego Shop-At-Home catalog (1-800-453-4652), it looks
like the best deal for a starter robotics kit would be the Universal Set
with Storage Case (#8062) for $68.  Not that you would need the case,
but it has a bunch of general purpose pieces, an assortment of gears and
pulleys, and six medium-sized wheels.  The second-best would be the
Giant Model Set (#8277) for $44.  It has the very useful longer beams,
but it has smaller wheels and few gears.  The Gears & Differentials
assortment (#5229) can be added for $4.50.  BTW, the Mini Motor (#5225)
for $17.50 is a compact, efficient gear motor that runs well directly
off the HB.  Shipping is free.  (Note:  I don't get any kind of kickback
from Lego--I'm just a big fan).
 
> Also, how do you interface a random DC motor with the LEGO gears? Can I just take one small gear and glue/epoxy it in place on the motor output? Is there another trick I should know about? (Sorry for the stupid questions, but I've never played/used LEGO before, unless you count playing DUPLO with the kids...)

The Lego gears are designed to press-fit onto the plastic Lego shafts,
which have a "+" cross-section.  To fit 'em to a round shaft, try gluing
a short section of shaft into the gear first (with epoxy?), then
drilling the appropriate size hole through the shaft.  If you glue a
Lego bushing onto the assembly before drilling, you might be able to
drill and tap a hole for a tiny set screw, too.

> What set are you using?

I'm using a bunch of sets that I've been collecting for years.  The big
one was the pneumatic claw rig for about $120, but I don't think they
sell it anymore.  It came with a motorized air compressor for the
pneumatics!  No matter how many sets I have, I still drool over the
catalogs.  If I didn't already have the HB, I would save up my meager
research assistant stipend to buy the Lego Mindstorms kit.

Hope this helps.  Good luck!

Hy,

I just read the compass.asm file. I don't know very much about assembly
langage, but it seems that some of the motor commands are used in it. 
Can I still use the 4 (or a least 2) motors outputs to drive motors while
using the compass.
Are there any limitations induced by the use of this programm?


Thanks

Hello. I don't know if it's proper to introduce yourself on this list or
not, so I'll just say I'm new here, and new to electronics in general. Lego
Mindstorms came out and got me interested, but I decided I wanted a more
hands on experience.

Anyway, quick questions about parts. The list says it wants 0.1uF monolithic
caps, with Digikey part #P4917-ND. I couldn't find this part in the catalog,
and I think I had problems ordering something similar for building a
miniboard. Part #P4923-ND is an 0.1uF mono cap, but it says it's 50v. Is
this what's needed, or do I need a lower or higher voltage? Also, a bridge
rectifier with part #DB101-ND is called for. In the catalog I found part
#DB101DI-ND. Is this acceptable?

Thanks in advance.

Kris

I wrote the compass routines, and needed at least 2 outputs. The
motors were the most convenient places to get output. 

I am just wondering if someone else has fixed the byte swapping
problem?   Every once in a while the results are byte swapped. I
started looking at it last night, and nothing seems to make sense??

I would prefer to keeep the present system.  Eudora Light (freeware) also
allows you to categorize the messages.  I realize that people who are stuck

Ja, but AOL mail is a POP account, meaning that they can check it using
Eudora Light, Outlook Express, etc.

Hi All,
Thanks  a lot for the help.
I just dont know what we would do without this mail list!!

All you need is a little direction when things are going wrong.
I had switched  cables from my 6.270 board.

THANKS A MILLION GUYS.

Choo, The v2x compass is great,I can't write code very well as of now but I
have it reading the compass following instructions from it.
Thanks to Tom Bruesehaver for his work.
It still "hangs up" every now and then reading 0's but there are
instructions how to fix.
See arcives at 5-12-97 and 5-19-97. Please let me know if I can help.

I used to work at AOL technical support, I would be very much interested if
you could figure out how to use AOL as a POP3, AOL is NOT a POP3 server.
AOL is very proprietery, one of the many reasons (and doesn't support DUN -
dial-up networking) that AOL isn't very good.  One thing that you can do,
which is still very unacceptable, is to go to www.aol.com and follow the
links for AOL Netmail, you can use this rather pathetic feature to check
your mail w/o having your AOL software loaded on the machine.  This BTW
doesn't support NT 4.0.

Subject: Some Questions
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Mailer: AOL 4.0 for Windows 95 sub 170

Hello, I have several HandyBoard questions:

1) How can I determine ( or does any body know ) the baud rate at which the PC
communicates with the Handyboard?

2) When IC attempts to Synchronize with the Board, what is going on "Behind
the scenes"?

3) Is it normal to get the message "Board not responding" while loading a
file? ( There is usually a short pause when this happens, but the file does
finally get loaded). I'm wondering if I might have a loose connection on the
RJ 11 jack.

4) I will be ordering IC ver. 3.1 shortly, but in the mean time, is there a
difference in running IC version 2.8 directly from DOS, or with Windows
running in the background?

Thanks for your help,
Dave

Erm... not quite.  I much prefer an email based distribution.  I don't
access the net interactively that often.  I just queue up my mail, and my
computer autonomously purges each evening while I sleep.  If the
handyboard list were a newsfeed, I would be required, at the very least,
to set up yet another process that bulk acquires the latest postings, as
well as my mail.  Worse case, I would have to bring up an interactive
session and tie up my phone line to access the latest HB postings.  Thank
you, no.

just my (010)b cents.

Try Farnell order code 325-351. It's more expensive than it has to be, though.

Hi,
any LCD Display 2*16 with a Hitachi HD44780 Controller will do.
There are several retailers. But I do not know about the UK.
Batron, Rohm (the HB original) are just two producers of LCD Displays.
I needed some LCD's (same as on HB) myself and ordered them from Rohm
(http://www.rohm.com/overview/europe.html).

Bye

Tom

After reading the Vector 2X Manual a couple of times, it seems that the SDI
pin (Serial Data In) has no function. It is even stated in the manual that
this pin is never connected. If this is the case, couldn't we use the MISO pin
from the HandyBoard to control the P/C pin on the compass? This would free up
the motor output.
I'm not that familiar with the 6811 SPI, so I don't know if this would make
sense?
(What data would the HB be transmitting to the V2X anyway?)
Thanks again,
Dave

I am aiming on using the 16x2 LCD from Maplins (part number DK63T, 8.89
pounds + vat, model number LM016L). I don't know of hand if the pin
layout is the same as the LM052L listed in the parts list but as I am
going to be using a connecting lead this is not a problem for me but it
may be worth finding out if you are intending mounting it on the board.

Hope this helps.

Hi all,

I'm looking to try and get some digital outputs from the Handboard. I've
read in the FAQ that this is possible using HC374(?), but I'm not sure how
to do this or where to hook bits up to.

Has anyone done this with some pictures or something to help me out? Any
help would be appreciated.

Thanks
Adam

I'm interested in building an underwater ROV and am wondering if anyone 
has any insight on buiding waterproof seals for the motors.(I'd like to 
eventually be able to go down 200 ft or so).

I realize this is a bit off topic but hope that someone may have some 
experience in the area. I will be using a handyboard communicating via 
SPI to a PC for the on board control and sensing.

Thanks,

200ft is about 7 ATM, roughly 103psi.  Your're gonna need some really
mean seals, and some serious current to turn motors within those
seals. Lots more current than the 293's can handle.

Probably easier to do what the big ROV's use.   Take something like a
stepper motor, and fill it with mineral oil.  Seal it in a case to
minimize (note, not prevent) the water from displacing the oil.  Make
it easy to change the oil on a regular basis, this is important.

For just playing in a swimming pool, maybe just use some cheap motors
and let 'em get wet.  No one will get electrocuted, and the motors
will last several hundred hours without anything special (I have done
it, and never had any trouble).  After a couple months sitting on the
shelf the motors will rust, that is why I say cheap motors, all you do
is replace 'em after they get stiff.  I little silicone spray
lubricant before each dive will help things last a little longer.
This is a good excersize for bouyancy work.

You could do what they do for aquarium filter pumps -- use magnetic
transfer.  Put a bar type magnet on the motor shaft and put a similar magnet
on a propeller just outside the hull where the motor is.  Since propellers
require low-torque it works fine.  The main down side is that this type of
system can have problems starting up if clogged with crud.

Subject: serial board
Priority: normal

I'm having trouble assembling the serial board. When I do the 
test(see snip below) I only get about 5 volts.  When I try and run 
the downloader, I don't see the green light come on.  (tried two 
different computers....)

any suggestions? thanks in advance,
						Owen

Now temporarily jumper the -12 volt supply (pin 6 of the MAX232)
to pin 10 of the MAX232, which is the input side of this output stage. Again measure the voltage at
pin 3 of J9---it should now read +10 to +12 volts.

Mathew,
       I dont know if they would handle 103 psi but the drive shafts used in
RC boats are sealed where they go through the bottom of the boat. If you put
your motor in a sealed enclosure with the shaft coming into the enclosure
you may be able to do something like that.

Hello,
I need help with the file types used by the handyboard. There are c, asm, icb,
and lis files. How do I work with them? For example, I downloaded the
compass.icb and compass.c files from the HandyBoard Site. Do I need to
download both of them to the handy board in order for the program to work? I
just received my handyboard a few weeks ago, so I really don't know how to do
this. I have read the HandyBoard manual a couple of times, so I understand
what each file type is, but my problem is: what to do after I have them loaded
into the handyboard?
Any help is always appreciated.
Thanks,
Dave

Hi,
load compass.icb first then compass.c
at the ic prompt type v2x();
compass will display heading on the lcd.

I'll send you the code I am using.
hope this helps.

Ok I've had another read of the FAQ, as well as a close look at the
schematics for the handyboard and the expansion board. Correct me if I'm
wrong, but I think I can use d0-d7 along with Y0 or similar and hook these
into a HC374 to get some digital outputs.

My question is, what address do I have to poke to in order to set or unset
these bits? I can't find this information anywhere, and I've gone over all
the source code I can find. Also what should the sequence be? I know it's
similar to the motor output routines, but I can't work it out.

Any help would be great,

Thanks
Adam

it's in the faq, at

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/faq/index.html#memmap

all you do is write to 0x4000, 0x5000, 0x6000 depending on whether
your latch is attached to Y0, Y2, or Y4 (respectively).  e.g.,
"poke(0x4000, 0xff);" will set all the bits of a latch attached to Y0
to 1.

Subject: platform choices...

Hi:

When I was in school, we built an autonomous mobile robot based on a six
wheeled, 'electric ride-on toy' from Toys-R-Us.  It had a sturdy metal
frame, two nicely geared motors, a decent battery.  It worked fairly well
and could carry a large payload (IR, ultrasound, bump sensors,
micro-controller, laptop, etc.).

Lately, I've become interested in building a new one, this time with a
better budget.  I'm planning on using a HandyBoard and PIC processor(s)
for the low level control and remote the high level control (video based)
to my O2.

Right now I'm trying to decide on a platform.  At this point, I'd prefer
to avoid building the platform from scratch, so I was hoping to use a RC
truck or another kiddie car with differential steering.

I've been playing around with a 'Tamiya King Blackfoot', because it was
fairly cheap, but I'm not happy with the results.  The turning radius is
huge, so large that I have a hard time turning it around in the halls at
work, so I how can I expect to do it in software.  The suspension was not
designed for a payload and with a high res B&W camera, WaveCom Jr.  2.4GHz
video transmitter, 16 AA batteries, and an electronic power controller,
the front end toes in making it hard to steer.  Also, it is geared for
speed and has a hard time starting at low speeds.  It's great fun to drive
around at work, but I think it's a bad choice for an autonomous robot.

As a result, I'm in search for another platform.

One thing that looked really interesting was the platform used by USC's
1997 RoboCup entry.

>From the paper, the platform is based on a RC truck that has some form of
differential steering.  However, I haven't been able to find out who made
the truck.  I tried asking on comp.robotics.misc and one of the team
members, but no luck so far.  Does anyone know what they used?

Does anyone have other suggestions?  To simplify the control, I'd prefer
something with differential steering or a fairly small turning radius.  In
a recent trip to Toys R Us, I didn't have any luck finding a kiddie car
with differential steering.  I may have to give up using something off the
shelf and build the entire thing from scratch, but if possible, I'd like
to avoid that.  Any ideas?

            Many thanks,
            Clem

From the pictures, it seems that this is a vehicle called 'Hercules' (or
something close).  I have seen it at the FAO Schwarz store recently.  I have
no details on how the truck operates, though the details on the box
indicated that it can raise and lower itself on the suspension.  I'll take a
closer look at the pictures on the site, and go compare them to the rc truck
to see if this is indeed the same model.

A little off the wall, but would it simplify the sealing if you could pressurize
the inside to something close to the pressure outside (equalize pressures).
A miniature CO2 cartridge with a release valve may help.

Hi all,

I'm having fun with my HB! For a software guy like me a 8 bit processor at 2 Mhz with 32K of RAM is a little small but it's so easy to add sensors to it it's just plain fun! But I'm an hardware newbie and I need more info on the sensors I can add to my little board.

I build my first robot a couple of days ago on a really simple wood+tape base: it was pretty stupid, running straight (or trying to run straight, I guess I need some shaft encoder to make it real straight) and backing up and turning when bumping into a wall. Primitive. And it felt completely apart on the third wall. I guess I need a better base to build on;^)

Now I have some work to do. I need to understand what kind of information all these sensors are going to return and what I can do from it. For example I played with a photocell plugged in the HB and I'm trying to see what I can do with it. It can detect a color change when it's close to a surface (I guess I can build a line follower from that), it can also detect a light source in a distance if you encase the photocell in a tube to narrow its angle. Is there any other uses?

I also got a reflective infrared sensor (I bought my HB from Gleason Research, and I got the sensor/motor kit they are offering with it) and I don't really know what to do with it! It seems to give me a reading relative to the sensor distance from a surface, but not always... And sometime I got "close" reading when I'm actually really far from any surface... Can somebody explain to me the logic behind this? There is so many infrared stuff in these electronics catalogs, and nowhere an explanation on the differences between them! What's the difference between my reflective infrared sensor and the one used by Rug Warrior to do shaft encoding? I tried to test mine on top of a piece of paper with black and white stripes and I cannot get a different reading on the black that I can get from the white... I'm confused ;^)

What kind of sensors are you using on your bots? And more importantly for what purpose did you select this sensor?

-- Eric

PS: Thanks to all of you for your recommendations on a LEGO set to use. I'm waiting for the LEGO and LEGO-DACTA catalogs to show up in my mailbox and I'll let you know what I do end-up buying.

One thing that was discussed before (I think on this mailing list?) that I
thought was pretty cool was a small robot with a microphone (FM wireless
mike perhaps?) and a photocell.  It would stay in the shadows while
trying to get close to people speaking.  Bump sensors and/or ultrasonics
sensors would also be nice to keep it from running into things much.

hello,

i am trying to send a data array to my PC from the handyboard thru the
serial cable.  a couple months ago, i was advised to use a terminal
emulator to capture the data.  this has not worked, however.  i was told
about using a null modem cable when attempting such a task, and i am
wondering how this works, and if it is the correct method.  also, can
anyone recommend a good terminal emulator?  thank you.

To me is seems, that multitasking futures of IC is very insufficient.
Is exist any small, inexpensive RTOS (real time operation system), that is tested for HB?
I'm hear that RTXC,  RTEK or  MCX11 may be that RTOS.
Is anybody tested some RTOS with HB?

The results you get from a reflective IR sensor will vary quite a lot
depending on surface color, roughness, angle of incidence, electrical
noise, etc.  My IR sensors were not good for much of anything besides
encoders, where the surface characteristics are controlled.

One technique that I use to filter noisy sensor data is to return the
median of three successive sensor readings.  This works extremely well
for the Polaroid sonar sensors for example, where an occasional huge
error can mess up other averaging schemes.

Hope this helps.  Good luck!

I just got my HB and am trying to test the sensor input, the docs say to
hook up the microswitch between signal and ground, when I do this and close
the switch my hb resets (because I just shorted it out...).  I tried putting
a resistor (330 ohm) in the circuit this stopped the reset but I could not
get the switch to change states in ic, it is always 255. I am new to
electronics and appreciate any help you can give.

There is the Micro Kernel from Jean J. Labrosse. It's a free kernel readily
available, also for the 68hc11. I have his book but haven't implemented the
full kernel yet, only parts of it. Its well written and cheap.

It sounds like you've got the switch between +5V and GND. What pins
exactly are you connecting to?

The sensor connections Are like this:

        _ _    _
        G +    I
        N 5    N
        D V    P

You dont need a resistor to use a microswitch.  The HB inputs have pull-up
resistors, so all you need to do is connect the input to GND to make it go
low.

You were right, also it seems my board is wired incorrectly analog(0)
controls the connector marked 7 on the hb.

Thanks for your help!

Hi All,
While I was building my sumo robot I managed to short a wire in my HB.
I put a wire that was connected to a multimeter and also connected to
another part of the robot, into a digital sensor input, sparks came out
and it smelt like burnt electronics.  I checked over the board and there
was no physical damage that I could see.  I downloaded IC and when I
reset it didn't say "Welcome to interactive c  blah blah blah", like it
usually does, the LCD just stayed the same, all full bars on top row and
all clear on the bottom.  There is obviously something wrong and I was
wondering if anyone may know of any quick tests or fixes for this sort
of problem.  Thanks for any help

Well maybe you should try replacing the HC11 for a start.. These things tend
to spoil easily and for no apparent reason.... :( (or is it just bad luck?)
That's funny, you shorted out something and it still can download?
Maybe you should also change the RAM chip for good measure.

Anyway does anyone know if I can use a NVRAM module (Dallas DS1230) in place
of the SRAM now so I don't have to use a battery just to keep the RAM
contents?

Hi all,

I just finished searching the FAQ for stepper motor driving tips and found
none. :(

Anyone know what the most efficient way to connect a stepper motor to the HB?

I know that they have these $8ish driver chips...but I've never used one.  If
anyone has any experience with connecting stepper motors to the HB I'd
appreciate some tips or links...

Thanks!!!
Gerald.

Ok,

I found the link to the Expansion board info website...it's all about a beta
version.  But, there appears to be enough information there for me to build
one myself.  (is that what everyone's done?)  I have never built something
from scratch like this, so I was hoping to find someplace that would sell me
the printed PCB and the components...or, I could scrounge the components from
the sources mentioned.

Q1:  Anyone have any PCB's for sale for the Expansion Board?
Q2:  Anyone know how much all the parts cost?

Thanks!
Gerald.

Justin,

I didn't see anyone reply to your RS232 Question.

ALthough I am a newbie to the Handyboard, I have been doing RS232 programming
off and on for years.  My conclusion is that there have been MANY null modem
configurations...but, they seem to be standardizing now.  And, it will often
depend upon your terminal program as to how it needs to be set up.

The easiest way is to purchase a 'Null Modem Adapter' from your local
PC/Electronics shop.  These usually have all the pins jumped which need
jumping.

Basically, they switch the send and receive lines, and I've seen them hardwire
the CTS.  I've done searches on the net and found several wiring diagrams.  

If you still need help, drop me a note and I'll see what I can dig up in my
old notes.

Gerald.

Allegro Systems UCN5804B is $3 and change from Newark Electronics. That's
not so many $s. It can drive steppers up to 1.25A. The interfacing is easy,
datasheet available on-line. Hope this helps, Art

I didn't look that closely at your program but I have included a routine to
read the analog ports that I know works.

After assembling and loading the program, you make two c function calls:
powerup_ad(); and read_ad(i); where i is the analog port address you want to
read.

Best wishes,

Sounds like a lot of it is still up and running if you can download.

I'd suggest going through the assembly instructions and performing the
tests at the end of each section.  You should, thereby, be able to isolate
smaller areas that may be fried and hence improve your chances of saving
your board.  Otherwise, take a look at the schematics and use them as a map
of the circuits that were involved in your short. 

Sorry this is so general, but it's hard to be more specific without knowing
exactly what part of the board the other end of the wire was on...

Good Luck,
	Owen

I can not get the sensors to respond correctly, for instance if I do
analog(0) the value of the sensor marked 7 on the hb is returned. After
going through all the sensors here is the layout I came up with:
I never got a reading on port 0,1,9 or 10

analog(x)         returns a value from the hb sensor marked
0                        7
1                        8
2                        12

12                        3
13                        2
14                        8
15                        4(dup)

Everything else seems to working correctly.
Any ideas what could be causing this?

Respected Sir,
           I have installed the newer version of IC into my PC. My 
Handyboard is ready with all parts assembled. Earlier I have done a 
project called "Mobile Robot Navigation of a Maze" with this handyboard. 
In this the robot navigates the maze and comes out of this successfully. 
I have implemented "Wall Fallowing Algorithm".I have to start another 
project with the same Handy Board. So I request your suggestion about 
any Algorithm you suggest or any problem you can suggest for this 
Handyboard mobile robot.
 
Thanking You Sir,
Madhusudan Gaddamidi

i think you may be using the wrong drivers.  make sure to set your
version of IC to load "lib_hb.lis" when it boots up.

I tend to agree.  Most people think that if the display is dead, the system is
dead.  The fact that you can download the program is a good sign.  I think, you
then need to prove that it was downloaded using simple known commands to
establish that it is listening, returning information, etc.  The art of
troubleshooting is not only what does not work, but more importantly what does.

Can you turn on various ports (motors)?  Does the system react the same each
time you reboot?  Can you read switches on the input port?  You do not have to
replace anything until you get an understanding of the limits of the failure.

Dr. Martin,

I am planning to build another robot with TCOMP on it, specifically the
TCOMP 3.5, can I still use IC for this board?

You can find TCOMP address here:
     http://www.teleport.com/~raybutts/tcomp35.htm

Thanks in advance.

probably -- i don't know if there are driver conflicts.  you probably
have to use the version of the pcode that doesn't hang if it doesn't
find an LCD.

Hi, 
I need to make a logic programm (eclipse or prolog) control the
h-board-robot. Does anybody have any experience with something like
that? 

I come from the AI and logic programming, and I don't have much
experience with communication protocols for serial ports. I suppose it 
must be possible to do something like having a program running on the
board listening to the serial port and doing whatever it is told and
giving information back to the port.

I'm not in the mailing-list, please answer directly to my email!

I think that Newark sells them for about $4.15 each.

Hi all,

I'd like to install sonar capabilities in my robot and I went to the FAQ to check how it was "recommended" to do it with the Polaroid OEM kit (It's at http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/sonar.html). this seems pretty straightforward to do but I'd like to use 2 sonars, not just one, to give my robot a more stereoscopic view of the world.

By making the assumption that I'm never going to fire both sonars at the same time but one after the other I did convince myself that I can share a lot of connections between the two sonars board: basically there is only the need for one additional pin.

There is 5 things necessary to connect a sonar board with the HB:

- ground (unregulated motor power): can be shared
- Vcc (unregulated motor power): can be shared
- timer input (A0, timer input 3): can be shared with the addition of two diodes to avoid a return current on the unused sonar (is the diode really necessary?)
- BINH (port D4): to inhibit the blanking. Can be shared too.

The only one that cannot be shared is the INIT line, connected to the port D5.

Can I connect my second board INIT to D3 for this purpose? Here is a crude diagram of what I'm thinking about:

+    : connections
->|- : diode
/\/\ : resistor
---- : wire


Board1 Board2

GND   -------+-------- Motor power ground
       GND --+

V++   -------+-------- Motor power +
       V++ --+

ECHO  --->|-------+---- Sensor 7 (A0)
       ECHO -->|--+

BINH  --------+-/\/\--- Pord D4
       BINH --+

INIT  ----------------- Port D5
       INIT ----------- Port D3


I can modify the code in the sonar.c to do bit_set(0x1009, 0x38) in sonar_init and having a sample_right and sample_left functions with the only difference being the bit_set(0x1008, 0x20) replaced by bit_set(0x1008, 0x08). As long as I don't use both sonar at the same time I'm fine right?

Does it make sense? Am I missing something crucial somewhere? The part I'm not sure about is the use of D3. If I understand the MC68HC11 reference manual correctly I can just use it the same way D4 and D5 are. D2 is apparently unusable as an output in the mode the SPI is in, but D3 should be possible to setup (I guess I'm going to reinstall monsterscope on my NeXTCube tomorrow to check my assumption!).

Otherwise is there a way to use a single Polaroid board for two transducer? This will reduce the cost (and the size) of this whole setup! And talking about cost, does anybody knows a cheap supplier for these sonars? Wirz Electronics want $50 for one and $94 for two... And it's $99 for 2 direct from Polaroid. Anybody cheaper (and no, I don't have a hackable Polaroid camera at home ;^)?

Thanks in advance,
-- Eric

I am busy building the HB but I cannot get it to work yet. Here are the
symptoms.
The serial board works as expected and performs all tests as described
in the implementation manual. RAM and HC11 are installed as well as the
LCD. I am using the sharp LCD. The only problem with the sharp is that
the pins are placed in such a way that I need a flat cable to connect
it.

I have tried several downloaders to get the pcode into the board. Most
of them tell me that the download went okay and some ever report the two
step process went okay (first the bootstrap loader, than the program).
But as soon as I try to reset the board and run IC version 2 or 3, it
cannot find the Handy Board. The LCD shows a solid row of blocks. I also
tried the pcode that runs the HB without the LCD, to no avail. IC
version 3.x cannot even communicate with the board. It refuses to see
the board and will not download anything.
 
I suspect the reset circuitry. Is there a test that can be performed to
make sure that data is actually downloaded into RAM before the board is
Reset ? How crucial is the Dallas Semiconductor voltage monitor chip ?
Can it be replaced by other, similar chips, like the one used in the
rug-warrior original plans (8810) ?

I asked about this a few months back, and Fred Martin himself suggested
I might try the very same connection scheme that you mention.  Here's
what he suggested:

According to Darkman's message of 4/21/98, the ECHO is indeed open
collector, so it ought to work fine.  I'll give it a try (using D2 for
the second INIT instead of D3), and report on the results of the smoke
test.

I would like to have my HB controlling a stepper motor.

It's a 4-phase unipolar permanent magnet motor.
The names of the inputs are like this:

1 - stepper phase #1
2-    ''     ''   #2
3-    ''     ''   #3
4 -   ''     ''   #4
5 - stepper common #1,3
6 - stepper common #2,4

I don't have any experience in stepper motor, can anybody give me some clues on
how to use it with the HB?

Keith

Keith,
     At first blush I would suggest the following connections:

Motor Out 0   1 - stepper phase #1
Motor Out 1   2-    ''     ''   #2
Motor Out 2   3-    ''     ''   #3
Motor Out 3   4 -   ''     ''   #4
Ground         5 - stepper common #1,3
Ground         6 - stepper common #2,4


Your program would look like:

long  someTime;
someTime = knob();  /* set time delay with frob knob */
while (1) { /* Forever */
  while (start_press()) {  /* Motor spins one way */
    fd(0);
    msleep(someTime);
    off(0);
    fd(1);
    msleep(someTime);
    off(1);
    fd(2);
    msleep(someTime);
    off(2);
    fd(3);
    msleep(someTime);
    off(3);
  }
  while (stop_press()) {  /* Motor spins the other way */
    fd(3);
    msleep(someTime);
    off(3);
    fd(2);
    msleep(someTime);
    off(2);
    fd(1);
    msleep(someTime);
    off(1);
    fd(0);
    msleep(someTime);
    off(0);
  }
}

    You might want to use an ohm meter to measure the resistance of the coils
before you start.  If the resistance is less and 5 ohms, I really wouldn't
expect too much from the motor outputs, but it might still do something no
load.  This is a crude approach, and you might want to spend some time
fiddling with the way you arrive at "someTime."  But I think this will get you
started.

Hope this helps
Pherd

Howdy folks-

I've got a quick question for  anyone out there have any experience with =
power distribution systems using multiple batteries...

If I have say six [more or less identical] batteries... am I better off =
to run them all at once (in whatever config I need) or to only switch on =

Hi All:

I am new to the handyboard list as I just got my handyboard.
I am trying to implement obstacle detection using the IR 
sensors. my question is that, if I want to have more than 
one ir emitter LED, ( to find out the direction of the
obstacle) , do I need to have as many detectors also,( the
sharp IS1U60 chip) or the one which is already there on the
handyboard will do? If I need more, how should I connect
them and also, how should I connect the extra IR output
LED's? I hope someone can help me with that.

Thanks.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII

X-Mailer: AOL 4.0 for Windows 95 sub 226

Hi all,

I'm still amazed with this Handyboard!  I had some free time 
to play this weekend and hooked up a Servo motor for the 
first time.  It was a small futaba that I got from B&G or 
Electronics Goldmine (I can't remember which).

Anyway, I have a few questions though...

Programming Question:

Q1)  The servo_deg() function requires a float.  How do I 
get it to use an integer if I want to put it in a loop and 
use an integer variable?

Q2) Is it normal for the servo to 'jitter' back and forth 
slightly for about a second after doing a servo_deg()?

Thanks!
Gerald

Subject: IR Landmarks
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII



Greetings!

Does any one know of some device that could be used to continuously
transmit a certain IR code. What I am trying to do is to have an HB
based robot try out some navigational tasks, based on what it senses
as well as have an internal representation of the floor space. This way
the robot can be made to acrry out tasks that require it to go from
a given location in its world, to a "goal" location.

In order to make things interesting, one could define certain landmarks.
Given the suite of sensors (think photosensors, IR reflectance, and ON/OFF
Switches, and IR detection), I was thinking of placing landmarks that
send a beacon, identifying themselves....I could simply use the SONy remote
and give it the proper landmark signal every time it gets to a particular
landmark, but it would be nicer if I could just place some device that
periodically emits the signal. 

One possibility that comes to mind is the iButton (that can be programmed
using Java). But I am clueless about the IR spec of iButtons and whether
they will be compatible with the sony ir codes. I can imagine putting
several iButtons emitting different codes marking locations in the
"world".

Deepak.

The servos which I've been using can run at two different power levels...
I think they are 7.5 and 5 volts.  I found that if I powered the servo
directly off the battery (stupid, yes), the servo would over-correct and
jitter.  But if I powered if off of one of the digital inputs, which I
think provide 5 volts, the servo settled down and behaved properly.
Messing around with sonar a sonar ranger also seemed to indicate that
servos are sensative to power fluctuations and I think the regulated
power of the digital inputs is more stable, too.

Hi all,

I'm looking for these bend sensors described in the "Mobile Robots" book, they look fairly interesting to implement bumpers or to use in wall following activities but I can't find them anywhere.

According to the book  p.117 "bend sensors are very inexpensive, under one dollar". So far I found them on only one place on the web and they are charging $10 a piece! I called AGE (the distributor listed in the yellow page in "Mobile Robots" as the source for this hardware) and they don't know what I'm talking about ;^(.

Help!

-- Eric

PS: Thanks for all your help. This mailing list has a tremendous impact on my robot! I can ask questions and I usually got multiple helpful answers. That's great. I'll make sure to build a web page with schematics and software when I have a working version of my robot  to help whoever come after me!

Welllllllll.. I wouldn't *recommend* it persay, however, the 6811 port of
the GCC compiler is free.  It works, I am running a program I compiled
with it right now in a terminal window.  At work, we use the Cosmic C
compiler for our 6811 based systems.  This compiler is amazing.  I simply
would never ever write assembly code again if I were using this compiler
at home; it easily outcompiles my ability to generate assembly code.

ftp://nyquist.ee.ualberta.ca/pub/motorola/68hc11/gcc/

gcc-6811-fsf.tar.gz and gcc-2.6.3.tar.gz.

You also might search www.eg3.com, they maintain links to a variety of
developement tools.  I have little doubt that you will find one for
*shudder* DOS, or even *spit* *spit* Windows.

Hi,
I'd like to use the line follower C routines included with the handyboard
software. What type of sensors do I need, where can I find them, and are there
schematics for connecting them to the handyboard?
Also, I would like my handyboard to control two 30 VDC ( ~3A) motors. I know
that WIRZ electronics has H-Bridge circuits, but does anyone have any
recommendations on which module to buy? 
Thanks for your help
Dave.

If you go look at the imagesco page the sensor is the Part number FLX-01 and=
 they are priced at $10.00 each. This is where I got my $10 quote ;^(

I guess there was a 50% raise in the price since Fred Martin updated the=
 FAQ...

Thanks anyway.

Subject: Picking a PIC

I'm looking to offload the processing of IR proximity sensors and
ultrasound to a PIC(s). I'm hoping to connect the PIC to a HandyBoard via
the SPI.

I'm trying to decide which is the right PIC for the job.

The PIC16C7x (PIC16C76) series supports SPI, can source 25mA/pin, 2 PWM
channels, and has 22 I/Os with 5 ADCs.  Cool part!  However, many people
seem to use the PIC16F84 because it's based on flash, so you don't have to
wait forever to erase them, but it doesn't have all the cool features of
the PIC16C7x, specifically SPI.

Emulating SPI in software seems like a silly waste of cycles.  I'd really
like to overlap taking measurements with sending data, which looks like it
could be difficult, if it's manually clocking bits out on the serial
interface. 

What would you guys recommend as a good general purpose PIC?  Digikey has
the PIC16C76/JW for $16.55 and the PIC16F84-04/P is $6.25.  I'm planning
to use the PICProto18 or PICProto3 from microEngineering Labs.  With PICs
being fairly cheap, it might be easier to just use multiple PICs rather
than handling the software complexity of doing everything in one chip.

Has anyone connected multiple PICs to a SPI bus, with the HC11 in master
mode and the PICs in slave mode?  The 68HC11 docs I have are a little
sparse on how multiple slave mode works.  Would I have one slave select
line to each PIC and then the HC11 code would have to poll the PICs by
selecting each one in turn with some sort of simple packet protocol?  It's
ashame that the 68HC11 doesn't support I2C, because it seems that they
solve this problem with that interface...

We've got a nice programmer at work, so I shouldn't have any trouble
programming either chip.  Another complication is that I don't have a PC,
so I was hoping to do all my development using one of the free assemblers
on my Unix box.

                   Thanks,
                   Clem

This is correct, although the bend sensors aren't all that great. I've got
the glove and the accuracy isn't very much, about the best you can expect is
what they've got from the glove , ie 4 different bend positions. But if this
is enough for your task then a $5 surplus glove from somewhere would be
ideal

easy way:

for (angle=1; angle<10; angle++)
    servo_deg((float)angle)

better way:

modify functions from servo.c to accept integers:

int servo_deg_int(int)angle)
{
  return servo(degree_to_pulse(angle));
}

int degree_to_pulse_int((int)angle)
{
  int dexcursion_int = 180;
  return (((angle*(SERVO_RANGE))/dexcursion_int)+MIN_SERVO_WAVETIME);
}


You could also replace degree_to_pulse_int() with an array of pulse lengths.
For 180 degrees this would use 362 bytes but would be faster.  Its the trade
off between speed and memory constraints.

int servo_deg_int(int)angle)
{
  int degree_to_pulse[181] = {1400, 1418, 1436,  ... etc.};

  return servo(degree_to_pulse[angle]);
}


Have not tried this code, but I don't think there are any typos.
You should also check to make sure angle is within the range of your servo
since none of the servo functions have any error checking.

Clem:

In a message dated 98-10-26 23:31:56 EST, you write:

<< I'm looking to offload the processing of IR proximity sensors and
 ultrasound to a PIC(s). I'm hoping to connect the PIC to a HandyBoard via
 the SPI.
 
 << I'm trying to decide which is the right PIC for the job.
 
 The PIC16C7x (PIC16C76) series supports SPI, can source 25mA/pin, 2 PWM
 channels, and has 22 I/Os with 5 ADCs.  >>


     Unless you need the A/D channels, look to the PIC 16C6x parts.  The only
difference is the A/D and price.

<< Cool part!  However, many people
 seem to use the PIC16F84 because it's based on flash, so you don't have to
 wait forever to erase them, but it doesn't have all the cool features of
 the PIC16C7x, specifically SPI.  >>

     I don't find errase time to be a problem most of the time.  I have been
working a  lot lately with PICs.  Generally I write some code, simulate it,
burn it, test it and after a while erase it.  In the last 3 months of steady
progress, there have been only a couple of times where I was actually waiting
for the eraser to erase the chip so I could blow it again.  (I have a weak
eraser which will only erase one chip at a time and it takes about 2 hours to
erase.)  Most of your time should be spent in the simulator checking out your
code.  Note though that it will not simulate the hardware functions of serial
I/O (I assume this is also true of the SPI channels).  When you put a byte in
the TXREG (serial transmit out), it takes a certain amount of time for the
"TXREG empty" interrupt bit to go on, as though the letter had been shifted
out, but you do not get to see the I/O bit toggeling.  Also I have not found a
good way simulate serial data coming.  I just manually put the letter in the
RCREG and then manually set the "Receive data available" bit in the STATUS
register.
 
 << Emulating SPI in software seems like a silly waste of cycles.  I'd really
 like to overlap taking measurements with sending data, which looks like it
 could be difficult, if it's manually clocking bits out on the serial
 interface. >>

     I have not done SPI myself yet, but plan to in the next couple of weeks.
But with the PIC hardware, it should be quite simple.  Given what a PIC costs,
I would suggest using the hardware SPI.
 


<< What would you guys recommend as a good general purpose PIC?  Digikey has
 the PIC16C76/JW for $16.55 and the PIC16F84-04/P is $6.25.  I'm planning
 to use the PICProto18 or PICProto3 from microEngineering Labs.  With PICs
 being fairly cheap, it might be easier to just use multiple PICs rather
 than handling the software complexity of doing everything in one chip.  >>

  I'd say the 16C77, same RAM and ROM as the 76 but you have more A/D, more
I/O available and it is 10 cents LESS.  It is wider than the 77, and I see
that as its only drawback.  This is not so much to do more on one chip, but
when you want ot move to a new project with different needs, you have the
ports.  I have moved code from one chip to another with only changing two
lines of code (the ones at the top that says:
	LIST	p=16c74	;chip type
	INCLUDE P16C74.INC

   The 16C67 is $1.32 less to loose the A/D, but that really isn't much, and
if you don't want A/D, just don't enable them.


 
<< Has anyone connected multiple PICs to a SPI bus, with the HC11 in master
 mode and the PICs in slave mode?  The 68HC11 docs I have are a little
 sparse on how multiple slave mode works.  Would I have one slave select
 line to each PIC and then the HC11 code would have to poll the PICs by
 selecting each one in turn with some sort of simple packet protocol?  It's
 ashame that the 68HC11 doesn't support I2C, because it seems that they
 solve this problem with that interface...>>

Not me.
 
<< We've got a nice programmer at work, so I shouldn't have any trouble
 programming either chip.  Another complication is that I don't have a PC,
 so I was hoping to do all my development using one of the free assemblers
 on my Unix box.
  >>

     Check their web site:

www.microchip.com

     If there is support for Unix boxes, it will be there.  I am currently
running Windows 95, but I have run the assembler on an IBM XT (8088).  The
simulator requires a minimum of x286.  I have just started using MPLAB, which
is there full up integrated windows development environment.  I'm still going
through growing pains with this, but it has a lot of features that I really
enjoy (click on a line in the error listing, and the source code comes up to
that line)...  But the serial simulation does not seem to be as good as the
one I had with MPSIM.  (I no longer get a "Transmit Buffer Empty" interrupt
after a time when sending letters.)

     Let me know if you have any other questions.  Also in all fairness I
should mention Ben Wirz (of Wirz electronics) preferrs the Flash stuff so you
might want to ask for his comments supporting this technology.

Hope this helps,

Hi Folks,
  I'm not actually subscribed to the Handyboard list as Fred is traveling an
unable to add me to the list. But I was hoping someone could take a moment to
clear up my confusion on why the documentation occasionally refers to the E1,
while the parts list has only the A1. Are they interchangeable, is one
preferable to the other? I'm about to order the microcontroller and I want to
make sure I get the right one.
  On a similar note, I'm having trouble finding the LCD display. I tried Newark,
Allied, Digikey and Jameco to no avail.
  Thanks for your help. Please respond directly to me since I'm not on the list.
  Thanks,
    Chris Prosser

Joe,

Your question implies that Interactive C does not compile to byte code,
so I thought I should take some time to post an explanation of how IC  
works.

Actually, Interactive C does compile, and in fact does compile to byte
code, which is then downloaded to the 6811.  The 6811 then has a byte
code interpreter, which executes the byte code.  

Being interactive doesn't necessarily require an interpreter;  because
the IC compiler and debugger are in fact the same program, things you
type at the IC> prompt are transparently compiled to byte code prior to
download.

Why wasn't IC designed to be an interpreter?  The advantage of compiling
to byte code as opposed to using a standard interpreter is primarily
speed.  The primary disadvantage is that the 6811 board won't contain
the original source code, so you must maintain the source solely on your
desktop computer.

On the other hand, why wasn't IC designed to compile directly to machine
code?  Advantages of compiling to byte code compared to compiling to
machine code include smaller code size, ease of multitasking, and making
it easier to do some run time error checking.  The primary disadvantage
is that byte code is slower than machine code.  

I hope this helps to clear up how IC works.

There was a guy on the HB list a few months back offering to sell bend
sensors for a reasonable price.  I figured that if he's into robotics,
then he's probably one of the good guys.  I took a chance and sent him a
few bucks, but I haven't received the sensors yet.

If he proves to be trustworthy and has more sensors to sell, then I'll
let you know.  If he doesn't deliver soon, then I'll post his name and
tell everyone that he's a bum!

	I am writing to you to let you know I have used your web-page. and
there is a lot of information that I have used.  I do have a particular
quesion, if you have time to reply.  My question and problem is with the
sonar.  I am currently testing the sonar using the handy board.  I am
using the set up that you have on your website.  

	The problem is I am getting readings from the handy board, which
is from the sonar.  The reading I am getting are ranging from -25000 to
+25000.  Some of the sample readings that I am getting are as follows;
200, 1400, 1800, 5000, 12000, 2400, 3000, -500, -3000, -14000, -24000,
-500, 13000, 23000.  The reading that I am getting are ranging from a
-25000 to a +25000.  I have tried this test with nothing in front of the
sonar for 30 feet, and I have also tried testing it with a book 3 inches
in front of it.  Even with the different tests, the readings seem
similiar.  

I don't know if this is normal, but it does seem like my data is
not ideal.

	Another problem I am having is the connection from the Polaroid
9-pin Connector to the 6500 Series Sonar Ranging Module.  I am using a
Polaroid ribbon wire, between these two.  The problem is, the ribbon is
bending a lot and the connection is not that good.  The ribbon wire keeps
coming out of the female connector.  Have you ever came across this
problem or has any of your email list servers, and how did they solve this
problem.

Subject: Handy board questions


	I am writing to you to let you know I have used your web-page. and
there is a lot of information that I have used.  I do have a particular
quesion, if you have time to reply.  My question and problem is with the
sonar.  I am currently testing the sonar using the handy board.  I am
using the set up that you have on your website.  

	The problem is I am getting readings from the handy board, which
is from the sonar.  The reading I am getting are ranging from -25000 to
+25000.  Some of the sample readings that I am getting are as follows;
200, 1400, 1800, 5000, 12000, 2400, 3000, -500, -3000, -14000, -24000,
-500, 13000, 23000.  The reading that I am getting are ranging from a
-25000 to a +25000.  I have tried this test with nothing in front of the
sonar for 30 feet, and I have also tried testing it with a book 3 inches
in front of it.  Even with the different tests, the readings seem
similiar.  

I don't know if this is normal, but it does seem like my data is
not ideal.

	Another problem I am having is the connection from the Polaroid
9-pin Connector to the 6500 Series Sonar Ranging Module.  I am using a
Polaroid ribbon wire, between these two.  The problem is, the ribbon is
bending a lot and the connection is not that good.  The ribbon wire keeps
coming out of the female connector.  Have you ever came across this
problem or has any of your email list servers, and how did they solve this
problem.

An occasional sporadic reading is normal and can best be handled by
returning the median of three readings.  Very noisy sonar data like
yours might be attributable to noisy power to the board, a weak
connection, or running motors, etc. at the same time.  The Polaroid
manual says that it's a good idea to make sure there are no other
electromechanical components operating while listening for a ping. 
Also, make sure you soldered the correct capacitor into the C7 position
on the sonar module board (see the HB web page) and that your solder
joints are clean.

The solution that worked best for me was to replace the female flat flex
connector on the sonar module board with .100" female header strips--a
1x4 and a 1x5 superglued together.  I glued up a 9-pin male header plug
to match, and used rainbow ribbon cable to connect the sonar module to
my custom dual sonar interface board (with the six diodes and the
resistor on it).  I also doubled up on the power and ground wires to
ensure adequate current flow.  It works great.  Anyone who wants more
details should feel free to e-mail me directly.  Good luck!

Hi!

When I work with the motor outputs, I found that the outputs are not linear.

The "motor(m,p)" changes the output only in an increment 10 of p.

Is there anyway I can get a more presiced output?

Thanks.

Hi All!

I'm having exactly the same problem! The download seem to work correctly
but after switching off and on the board again it seem not to start over.

I have momentarily used another reset device. I dont know exactly the
specification but it seem not to wait for 350ms to put the reset.

My suspect is this reset device - i will get the DS1233-10 soon and hope it
will
work then.

What i'm using is another LCD, but also based on the HD44780 controller,
what i think
is the important point. 

Another thing i'm sure about if it is correct is that the current on the
board is only about
4.8volt (measure with an old analog device). Maybe the DC adapter i'm using
has not enough
power. Its build for 12V/1.25A but does only give about 11.0V although with
or without the handy 
board connected.

Has anybody a idea what to do?
Is it a good sign if the download-mode does work and the second line of the
LCD is black?
Can the software be the problem?

Bye
Bernd

The motor controls in the Handy Board library supports only 8 levels of power.

Upgrade!

Get the Smooth PWM version made by Julian Skidmore  in the software contributed page on the Handy board web site (http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/).

You will have to do multiple things:

1- Get the new pcode_hb.s19, install it on your board
2- Merge the differences between the latest HB libraries and the ones from Julian. It's fairly easy to do and you end up with the latest changes from Fred Martin and the smooth PWM code from Julian in one neat package. Just get the two lib_hb.c and compare them, it's fairly evident what the changes are (Fred changed a function from IC to native and Julian changed the motor controls to match the changes in the pcode).

I did that for my board and I can now control my motors with great precision. It's really appreciable when you are trying to use the feedback from your shaft encoders to regulate the motors at the same speed. Before installing the smooth PWM my 'bot was always over correcting and basically never ran on a straight line, swerving right and left. Now it's smoothly correcting and it's running (almost) in straight line

Is there any chance for the smooth PWM algorithm to make their way into the supported release of the pcode and libraries? This is a real improvement over the standard one...

I'd appreciate mucho any help and ideas you all have

I am building my HB, finally got the caps and crystal osc. working, and
ran the HBDL program to download. All good and fine. I go off and solder
in the transparent latch, and while doing so I knock the board. I go back
and check that to see what problems I've created:

pin 26 gives +5volts
pin 5 gives me a 2MHz signal (about 700mV pp), and 2.8V

but -> pin 1 is giving me 2.85V && The Batt LED will not go off && I can
       no longer get into bootstrap mode :( 

Did I blow my 6811? What other things should I check? the only other stuff
I have installed is the memory chips

Thank you very much

I picked up a 20x4 LCD from B. G. Micro (see their on-line catalog at
http://www.bgmicro.com/prodlit.htm and view page 2 - the LCD is the one in
the upper right at $8.95, part number LCD1002).

For 2x16, it will work just plugging into the HB.  I poked memory locations
related to the display size and got 2x20 going (a dirty hack, but I did not
have to recompile the p-code assembly).

I do get one problem - every once in a while the displayed text will wrap
to the location following the flashing heart.  I don't know if this is a
code issue or something with the LCD.

If anyone knows of the 20x4 P-code, let me know.  I remember reading
someone had done this, but cannot find the info any more.

Hi Everyone:

I am trying out the infra red emission and detection with 
the Handy Board. I have succeeded in the emission part 
but the detection circuit is not working. I know that 
the emitter LED is fine , with the help of Radio Shack
Infrared sensor card. can anyone give me any hints as 
to how to get the sharp detector to see the radiations 
or maybe do it with the help of any other detector also.

Thanks a lot.

Bye,

Raj

Hi all,

Electronics Goldmine has some notebook pc IRDA ports for $2!
<http://www.goldmine-elec.com/Specials.htm>

I think it would be Great to use a couple of these to get 2 Handyboards 
to talk with eachother.  Or, get one handyboard to talk with my Notebook
PC (which already has an IRDA port).

Has anyone done something like this?  
Does anyone know anything about these IRDA units or how difficult
it may be to control/interface them?

Thanks!
Gerald

HI,
Currently, I'm using 2 dc motors to drive my robot. The voltage of the
motor is 12v rated. and the rated current is 300mA. These motors are
directly plug into the HD for use. As
a result, the robot cannot travelled fast and sometimes halt suddenly due
to the insufficient voltage . How should I supply a 12v souce to such motor
which 12V on the HD ? 

I am trying to use this method :
Firstly, I connect both the motor's wires to a external driver IC 298.
Next, I extend out the wire  from the IC 298 to the Motor Port 2 and 3. I
supply the voltage source using external alkaline battery of 12 V (Each
battery is 1.5) to the Driver IC298. Is there any danger that will damage
the HD or the Motor itself for such connection ?

Please help. I really need this information urgently. Thank you very much.

rgds,
phillip

The Sharp IR detector is designed to respond only to modulated IR signals.
The card from Radio Shack will indicate whether the LED is illuminated,
but it won't tell you whether it's modulated at the proper frequency.
Perhaps that could be the problem?  Just a guess.  Good luck!

Well, I'm cheap ;^) I'm using the free version.

I might be lured into buying the commercial version: I'd sure love to have structs and multidimensional vectors. I think I will miss function pointers...

Is there any source coming with the commercial version? I'm not interested in the source of the code running on the host, but I'd sure like to have the source of the stuff running on the handy board, the infamous pcode_hb.asm.

Hi Will:

What you say might be the reason for my problem hence I bought a
matched IR emitter and detector pair from Radio Shack and tried the
same thing. Here again, the emitter is sending the signal but
the detector is not able to see it. I tried connecting the receiver
to a digital port directly without any resistor and analysing the
input from the port by using the digital(int) function. It did not
show any level change. Basically, I am trying to 
implement something similar to the REC 80 routines by Danny Negro
and Max Davies' work. I hope to be able to transmit the codes
from the IR transmitter of one handyboard and have another HB
receive and decode the signals. I even tried Sriram's code  (I got
it from the HB mailing list archives ) which
sends out a signal similar to that sent out by the sony remote but
the Sharp Chip was still not able to receive/decode it. 
Another question I have is, if I want my handyboard to send signals
in different directions, do I need to have as many detectors as
emitters or one detector will do?

Thanks for your help.

Raj.

I just did this.  

First you need the source code for IC, the compiler, and apparently
Unix since the source code requires
some pre-processing and the script to do that works
under Unix (which I don't have).

An alternative method requires the source code, the
*.s19 file and the 68HC11 pink book and some determination (I have
that).  I edited the *.s19 file and replaced the appropriate numbers
(4 or 5 places) to let the program work with a 4 by 20 display. 

Due to the way that the display maps the memory to
the displayed lines you have to print:
"The first line      The third line
The second line      The fourth line"
to get the proper order of the display. 

-Craig

(maybe I could have just asked Newton Labs but
that would have be too easy....)

Transmission and reception of IR data is quite different from using IR just to
bounce it off obstacles to detect their presence.  To exchange data with IR you
will almost certainly have to use interrupt driven assembler code which can be
very difficult.  There are so many variables at play that when you first try it
and it doesn't work you have no idea where to look:  is it the transmitting
hardware, the transmitting software, the receiving hardware, or the receiving
software?

My best suggestion is to start from a known working base.  Choose a remote
control that you have at home that works with your TV or VCR or whatever.  Next
get your Handyboard to recognize signals from that remote perfectly.  Then get
your Handyboard to successfully send those same signals to the TV/VCR.  Then put
exactly the same code into your second HB and proove it can do the same thing.
From there on it should be a piece of cake to send IR data from one to the other
because you have already prooven that their hardware and low-level software are
working correctly.

My Handyboard IR routines at http://WWW.CAM.ORG/~mdavies/HB/ir.htm should help
you a lot, making it unnecessary for you to write any additional assembler code.

I just finished adding the motor output circuit to my HB.  I have built and
tested the interface board.  I connected the interface board to the HB to
download the test code to test the HB and I keep getting the "wrong port or
board mode" error.

Not knowing what to do I disconnect the HB and play with the interface board
a bit.  I try to download to just the interface board, the red PWR led is
on, but the green serial led never lights up.

Playing a little more I start up a terminal program set it to a low speed
and try to send characters to the interface board, red led is lit, but still
no green led blinking.

Any ideas?

     Pine 8 for the L293D is "Motor Power."  There are two ways to get to
this.  1) Pull the chip from the socket, lift the pin so it points straight
up, then wire-wrap a new supply wire to this pin.  Or scratch the trace
leading to pin 8 U11 and apply power to J13.  I have forgotten what the Max
Voltage that the 293 can take is, but it is above 12V I'm sure.

The dual sonar interface board is simply a small (1.5" sq. or so)
experimenter's PC board from Ripoff Shack with the six power diodes, the
one resistor, and three header plugs soldered onto it.  One plug goes to
the HB and the other two go to the sonar modules.  There's also a jumper
to disconnect ECHO from the second module.  Because the wires were
wimpy, I doubled up on the power and ground wires.

I've had the one sonar working for a while now, but just recently I
finished getting both sonars plugged in.  The part that works great is
the header plug and ribbon cable part.  The part that doesn't work so
great is the shared ECHO.  Either one works fine alone, but there is
definite signal contention on the ECHO.

I'm using PD2 for the second INIT, and the BINH is shared by both--no
problem.  BTW, in order to use PD2 as a digital out, you need to do a
bit_set( 0x1009, 0x3C ) in the initialization routine instead of the
bit_set( 0x1009, 0x30 ) that's in Fred Martin's sonar.c.  I'm not sure
why, but the FAQ said to use 0x3C, and it works.

I think I might try using a couple of blocking diodes, like you
suggested, to see if that clears up the ECHO signal contention problem,
unless someone out there has a better idea.  I thought about using a
chip with a single OR gate (if there is such a thing) or using PD3 to
control a multiplexor, but those seem like overkill.  Any suggestions?

I promise to post all the details on my web page when I get it all
figured out.

Thanks for doing all this testing and reporting it to us. I do really appreciate it.

And I'll vote for the low tech version: use two diodes...

 hello

       can someone please tell me what does the following command line mean?

       bit_set(0x0e, 1 << (4 + motor));

       i know that 0x0e refers to memory location $0E but how does bit_set
       work? is it similar to poke? and more importantly, what operation
       does '1 << (4 + motor)' perform?

       any help will be appreciated. thanks.

In binary 1 is represented by  0000-0001

1 << 1 is 0000-0010 aka 2
1 << 2 is 0000-0100 aka 4
1 << 3 is 0000-1000 aka 8

You get the idea? x << y means slide x to the left y times.

motor is probably a number between 0 and 3. 4+motor is then a number between 4 and 7.

so, to go back to your example the result of  1<<(4+motor) is one of:

1000-0000
0100-0000
0010-0000
0001-0000

And my guess is that bit_set(address, value) is equivalent to poke(address, peek(address) | value). I don't have any documentation here, so I don't know what is stored in 0x0e, but it could be the place where you turn the motors on and off. And the code you are looking at is turning a motor on without touching the other motors.

Hi Ronald!

Ok - my HB is working now. I got the right 1233-10 (10 means 10% of 5v -
reset
is going up on 4.5v). This seem to work better. Second thing is the 350ms
delay
seem to be necessary in normal reset.

The second thing was that the power supply on the board was relativly 
unstable (dropped when i touched with an digital probe) till i finished the
last
step adding the L1 - 1 uH - iron core inductor. Since then the whole thing
works
stable!

Good luck in trying your board getting to work!

Bye
Bernd

Hi all,

I have writen a code, when i download it i received following message.
"c:\ic\libs\speed.icb(1): Code and data segments collide --
overflow of 681 bytes"
After that I reduced the size of code and downloaded it, It was
successfull. I got following message.
Downloading 5978 bytes (addresses 8000-9759): 5978 loaded
Downloading 5082 bytes (addresses 975A-AB33): 5082 loaded
Downloading 19 bytes (addresses AB34-AB46): 19 loaded
Code loaded.

Can any body tell me what is the maximum size of code i can
download. From where I can find out size of my code. What is the meaning
of above three lines where it says 5978,5082 and 19 bytes loaded.
Does the above information means that my code is about 11k.
Is it possible to load larger size of code from this.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.



Sincerely,
Javaid Iqbal

hi,
I noticed that the picture of the HB in the Web page is slight different
from mine. There is no thick trace on my HB to be cut. However, the HB in
the web page has a thick trace on it ? My version of the board is 1995,
Fred Martin. 

Please help. I do not know where to cut it . Maybe,  can I do proceed in
such a way that I mention to you of how I connect up the power-up the HB
externally ?

Sorry, I cannot help you. My board look exactly like the one on the picture. It's a Handy Board v.1.2 I bought assembled from Glasson Research. Does somebody knows  what board Phillip is using?

Hi

Most of the IR LED's sold at Radio Shack are the 840-880 nm wavelenght type.
The Sharp tin can requires the 940 nm wavelength IR beam if my memory serves
me right, it also requires to be modulated at 38 or 40 kHz depending on the
model. This 38 or 40 kHz should  also be modulated on and off to get a
response from the sensor.

I currently have the IRPD http://www.robotstore.com/ hooked up to my Handy
Board  and have good results.
If you go that way let me know and I 'll send you some code in c.

I hope that helps and correct me if I'm wrong!

Ja,
	I could not tell you for the life of me what 'type' f a HB it is,
but I remember someone once telling me that you could just remove one of
the pins from the driver chip instead. This method would be less final
(ie, just bend the lead up and if yyou decide to change it you could just
bend it down), but again, for the life of me, I cannot remember which pin!
Check the schematic, it should be pretty obvious. Or follow traces on the
HB.....

Philip:
     I depends on how many motor driver ports you want to have on the new
voltage.  If you have just two motors, then lifting (and wirewrapping) pin 8
for one chip whould be enough.  The motor outputs affected are nearest to the
chip modified.  I noticed in your previous note that you are having some
trouble finding the trace, so lifting the pin would be the most reliable.
Also if you need more drive current, you can "piggy back" the 293 chips.  Just
lay one chip on top of the existing one and solder pin 1 to pin 1, pin 2 to
pin 2,...  You can get more 293s from Wirz electronics (www.wirs.com).


Pherd


<<hi Pherd, 
Is it Have to lift up both the L293 chips and supply power to both L293 ?
Or is it scratch both the trace to L293 ? Thank for your infor .>>

Hi all,

My robot has come to the stage where its time to start writing the basic
navigation routines. I have two encoders on each rear drive wheel and two
caster type wheels on the front.I have been trying to put some basic
software modules together but without much luck. Ive wrote two functions
that get started as processes which control each motor by monitoring a set
of global vars. There are two vars one for each wheel which is the desired
velocity and two vars for actual velocity. What i tried to do is set the
desired velocity and then the two processes increase motor speed until the
desired velocity is reached by comparing the variables, But the BOT seems to
zig zag when trying to move slowly, at speed it seems o.k. Now this is just
for straight lines, i think i will struggle when i am trying to do 90deg
turns and so on. I guess what i need is some sample code if anybody could
share some with me. I am after some kind of software engine where you send
commands to it like forward, backward, turn-left etc and then i can have a
program running that sits on top of the engine giving movement commands
whilst monitoring collision sensors.


any help would be appreciated, Thanks Russ......

Hello, all:

<DELURK>

    I've been following this list for some time now, but since I didn't have
an HB, I didn't contribute to the discussion.

    Now, I've just ordered my HB because I plan to start building. But I
have a question...

    I have a model police car, 1:12 scale R/C. I thought that it would be
neat to have the car "patrol" an area containing other R/C cars, and
determine which ones were "speeding". Obviously K-55 doesn't make a radar
gun 1:12 size, so I gave it some thought. Why not use sonar; a Polaroid-type
module, but smaller?

    I figure that the speed of the car can be derived from the distance from
the police car to the perp as measured by two consecutive samples at a known
time interval. Some quick math should give me ds/dt, distance over time.
Exceeding a pre-set limit would trigger the autonomous searching.

    Do you think that this is do-able? Comments welcome.

Subject: Cool robot platform and a question...

Thanks to the help of Todd Graham (thanks Todd), I've found a really cool,
low cost, RC robot platform.  It's the same platform used by USC's 1997
RoboCup entry, the Nikko Hercules!  It has 4 hard plastic drive wheels,
dual drive motors, differential steering and the ability to raise and
lower the chassis (changing the angle the wheels have to the ground, which
changes the turning radius and the amount of wheel that has contact with
the ground).

I was planning on building my own H-bridge for it, and was surprised to
find that it already has a dual H-bridge and a fairly decent run time.
So, rather then build or purchase a new H-bridge I would like to hack
apart the one that comes with the car.

Being a software weenie, I don't have any experience reverse engineering a
circuit.  I started probing around for continuity to try and figure out
what's what and I didn't get very far.  When I tried to check voltages
with the power applied, when I touched the circuit (or even got the probe
near the circuit) the car would start twitching wildly, which makes
debugging difficult.

I was wondering if anyone had any luck interfacing to this or another
Nikko car with differential steering.  I'd hope that the circuits are
similar...

TR10    TR12      TR 13
                  TR 11

                  TR6
TR7     TR5       TR4

The controller board has 8 power transistors, 10 & 12, 13 & 11, 6 & 3, and
7 & 5 are connected to common heat sinks, and the heat sinks for 11-13 and
5-7 are electrically common.

The circuit has a 22 pin DIP chip that I would guess interfaces with the
radio and controls the bridge.  If the DIP is parsing the radio signal and
generating control signals for the H-bridge, I'd guess that I will have to
remove it from the circuit and tap directly into the transistors.  Also,
the car is a bit fast, so I'd like to be able to PWM the motors.  Any
ideas?  Would it be easier to just start from scratch?

                  Many thanks,
                  Clem

Hi Dave,
 I have a line tracker kit and also the IRPD infrared proximity detector
kits from Lynxmotion constructed but do not know how to connect them to the
handyboard.
I contacted Jim Frye with Lynxmotion but he said he was not familiar with
the handyboard.
Please let me know your connections and possibly share some code if you
have any success.
				
					Thanks

Clem,

In a message dated 98-11-03 01:04:33 EST, you write:

<< I started probing around for continuity to try and figure out
 what's what and I didn't get very far. >>

     This is the right place to start.  If you can see the circuit traces,
copy them to a piece of paper.  The part your really trying to find is which
lines connect to the controlling chip.  I figure that you have two choices
here, one is a simple H bridge type ciruit with one or two outputs from the
chip to the Amp per motor; the other choice is a linear amplifier driven from
the control chip with feedback from the power amplifier.  A clue to the latter
would be finding a pair of resistors (called a voltage divider) connected near
the output.  (This would have two resistors connected together in series, one
end connected to the output, the other end connected to ground and the middle
connected to the controller chip).
     Once you have the outputs from the chip, it's time to find out what they
normally do.  Attach minus of your volt meter to the minus terminal of the
battery.  With the power on and the car off the ground, touch the plus lead of
your meter to these points on the controlling chip.  See what happens when the
car is commanded to go forward, reverse, turning,...  Do each test with DC,
AC, and Pulse detection on your meter.  (I assume that you don't have an
O'scope.  If you can get to one, use it to make these measurements.)  Once you
know what the control chip does to drive this amplifier, you remove the chip
and you tap into its place and mimic what it did.

<< When I tried to check voltages
 with the power applied, when I touched the circuit (or even got the probe
 near the circuit) the car would start twitching wildly, which makes
 debugging difficult.>>
     Radio circuits are sensitive and low level RF noise can make them do
stuff.  try twisting the meter leads together as much as you can, connect the
minus meter lead to battery minus and then test.  You also might consider
touching the tip of the  plus lead to the tip of the minus to discharge it,
although the meter resistance should have done this (sometimes the meter
impedance is high enough to make this worthwhile).  If your hitting the gates
of FETs, you could be charging/discharging them enough to turn them on,
although I would be most surprised to find that you have a gate driven by a
high impedance circuit.
     Be very careful not to touch two points with the probe tip at the same
time,  Sensitive circuits toast easily.
 
<<Would it be easier to just start from scratch?>>> 
     I don't think so, though it might be easier to buy an H bridge circuit
and replace the existing one.

Hope this helps
Pherd

That ought to work fine, provided the cop is almost directly in front of
or behind the "perp"; then no correction for angle is necessary.  The
Polaroid sonar detects objects within about a 10-degree cone.

It might still work if the sonar is angled across the "roadway", but it
would take some careful calibration:  You could estimate the relative
bearing of the perp vehicle based on the amount of time for it to cross
into and then out of the 10-degree cone (you'd need to keep sampling at
a high rate).  That, along with a couple of range readings and a bunch
of trigonometry, ought to give you both the speed and the direction of
travel.  Good luck!

im working on a project for school, a digital oscilloscope for your pc, 
but im running into some trouble concerning the ADC part of the project, 
specially with the noise introduced by the ADC itself to the signal 
being digitized, (im using a Harris HI3318 for each channel), in the 
manual and data sheets you have separate grounds for digital and 
analogue supplies, yet in the diagrams i`ve seen concerning adc`s they 
all have a common supply, provided they use some capacitors for  
filtering (i supposse). If anyone has some advice concerning this matter 
please repply at:

bernardo72@hotmail.com

PS: I know it has nothing to do with the handyboard, but ive read a 
couple of messages from people that are very good at electronics and 
maybe they can lend a hand.
thanks again

To Integrate Assembly Code into a "C" Program

The variables declared here become globals in C.
A simple example to double a number entered from a =

"C" program, multiply it in assembly code, =

then displayed on the Handy Board LCD display,
will be explained here . =

The process is as follows:  write the assembly code, =

assemble the ASM file and convert it to an "ICB" file,
add "ICB" to lib_hb.lis file, and call the variable or
subroutine from the MAIN "C" file. For Example,
the name of the file is ASMTEST and the extensions =

determine the type of data on files.
ASMTEST.ASM    ; a file written in assembly code
ASMTEST.ICB    ; a file that was assembled into "S" =

               ; records.
ASMTEST.C      ; "IC" MAIN function program
LIB_HB.LIS     ; list of files to be executed
AS11_IC        ; a batch file that assembles, creates  =

       ; lables definitions of entry points and C variables

For this example the commands were as follows:
AS11_IC ASMTEST  ;this batch assembles the ASMTEST.ASM
file and outputs ASMTEST.ICB. The following programs
were tested for the example multiply by 2 and display:

* file: asmtest.asm, first assembly file to be tested 29SEP98*/
* Sample icb file */
* origin for module and variables */
#include "6811regs.asm"
            ORG      MAIN_START
* program to return twice the argument passed to us */
subroutine_double:
            ASLD        ; shift left accumulator to multiply by 2
            RTS          : return of subroutine =

********************end of ASMTEST.ASM*********************

S9030000FC
S105872B05390A

  please send bugs to Randy Sargent (rsargent@athena.mit.edu)
  original program by Motorola.
subroutine_double 872b *0007 =

******************END OF ASMTEST.ICB FILE *****************
***********************ASMTEST.C FILE BEGINS HERE**************
/* file:asmtest.c, by  Hector Noriega, 28SEP98 */
/* To test writting assembly*/

void main()
  {
   while(1)
    {      =

         printf("asmtest # =3D %d\n",double(5)); /*assembly subroutine*/
     }
    } =

**********************ASMTEST.C FILE ENDS HERE***********
****************LIB_HB.LIS *******************
lib_hb.c
c:\ic\ic\work\asmtest.icb
asmtest.c
*******************END OF LIB_HB.LIS***************
To finish this procedure run "IC"  which automatically
downloads and executes the MAIN() , the turn =

the Handy Board "OFF" and then "ON". =

"The asmtest # =3D 10" should be displayed on the =

Handy Board's LCD screen.

Good luck

Hello, my name is thierry and I am student in a high school of engineers in 
toulouse in France. I send you this mail because I have a problem to 
download a program to board with 68hc11a1fn. In France, I bought a book of 
joseph l.jones and anita m.flynn and I designed a rug warrior board which 
was in this book but I I modified it a little. I  striped all sensors of 
rug warrior and I connected the 68hc11 to 2 motors (or modified servo 
motors).
When I connect the board on the com2 and I put mod a and mod b on 0 and I 
load a program (my program or Pcode_rw or Pcode_hb), it isn t good.

With dlm (dos version 2.4 jun 8 1995, I have these results)
(With the 68hc11a1 I choose these options : port timeout 2000 ms and 
expected miniboard)  

Dlm Pcode_rw -port com2 -ram -256

.

Synchronizing with board?ok
Sending  Pcode_rw.s19  at 9600 baud

During the dowloading user's hex file
Board error : not written correctly !


I hope you will be able to help me because I try to run this board for 2 
years and I don t arrive alone.
Do you have an idea ?

A the beginning , I tried to do a program in  C language then I compiled it 
with icc11 and crt.s . There weren t mistakes of compilation and link but 
that I didn t never succeed to download anythings.
After I tried with Pcode_rw and Pcode_hb but it was same thing.
I verify the hardware of board but I didn t find a problem.

I used on my board the following components : maxim 233a, memory of 
32kbytes with lithium battery, L293a.

I don t understand why I arrive to download the boot program but after 
there a bug.

Thanks for all

thierry

Hi,

I am having problems with one of the converted SPI pins, specifically
the MOSI pin. This is what I did,

poke (1009, 0x3c);
bit_set (1008, 0x08);

I then checked the pin with a logic probe and got a low. I sifted
through the other pins and they worked. Also I tried this onto two HBs.

Thank you,
Faris

Hello, my name is thierry and I am student in a high school of engineers in 
toulouse in France. I send you this mail because I have a problem to 
download a program to board with 68hc11a1fn. In France, I bought a book of 
joseph l.jones and anita m.flynn and I designed a rug warrior board which 
was in this book but I I modified it a little. I  striped all sensors of 
rug warrior and I connected the 68hc11 to 2 motors (or modified servo 
motors).
When I connect the board on the com2 and I put mod a and mod b on 0 and I 
load a program (my program or Pcode_rw or Pcode_hb), it isn t good.

With dlm (dos version 2.4 jun 8 1995, I have these results)
(With the 68hc11a1 I choose these options : port timeout 2000 ms and 
expected miniboard)  

Dlm Pcode_rw -port com2 -ram -256

.
.
.
.

Synchronizing with board?ok
Sending  Pcode_rw.s19  at 9600 baud
Board memory error  wanted 00, got 3e at address 001e
Board memory error  wanted 01, got 00 at address 001f
Board synchronizing error

With the window95 dlm32
.
.
.
.
During the dowloading user's hex file
Board error : not written correctly !


I hope you will be able to help me because I try to run this board for 2 
years and I don t arrive alone.
Do you have an idea ?

A the beginning , I tried to do a program in  C language then I compiled it 
with icc11 and crt.s . There weren t mistakes of compilation and link but 
that I didn t never succeed to download anythings.
After I tried with Pcode_rw and Pcode_hb but it was same thing.
I verify the hardware of board but I didn t find a problem.

I used on my board the following components : maxim 233a, memory of 
32kbytes with lithium battery, L293a.

I don t understand why I arrive to download the boot program but after 
there a bug.

Thanks for all

thierry

Hi,

Does the Handy Board use flow control?
Thanks.

Hello, all:

    I am having problems downloading the pcode_hb.s19 file. Here's the
symptoms...

    My HB passed all of the construction tests as outlined in the manual,
including the DS1233 power monitor. The HB goes into bootstrap mode no
problem, but the download seems to barf just after the monitor download.

    When I download the s19 file for the first time (during Chapter 5), the
HBDL program (the Win95 downloader) downloads the monitor successfully, and
if you watch the lights on the HB, the PWR LED will flicker as the D/L
occurs. IIRC, that's normal. However, just after HBDL finishes the monitor
download, the BATT light comes on. I then get the error "Error at address
0x0000". Does this mean that the board reset and is now out of bootstrap
mode?

    I tried two different adapters and the same thing happened. One is a
12v/500mA DC adapter from Radio Shack and the other is a 12v/1000mA AC
adapter. Both were plugged into the serial interface board. I checked the
voltage level of the 5v rail during the download -- rock solid at 5.00v.

    If the 1233 is bad or marginal, does anyone have a spare that I can buy?

My IC 3.2's do not include the smooth PWM but the code from the 
handyboard web site works OK. I say "my IC3.2" because although the
disc says 3.2 the handyboard says 3.1. Does anybody know if the bug
fix concerning the analog inputs on the web page is necessary with
version 3.2?

Hi all,

Iam trying to make up my mind on which type of motor to use on my robot,
I have got two stepper motors with built in quadriture encoders and also two
12v 2amp
D.C. motors with gearbox's. I have made a test bot built from Lego with two
9Volt Lego motors
with Microsoft mouse contact type encoders fixed to the drive shafts. Every
thing seems to work ok
but a find I have not got a lot of control or precision moving at low speed,
also I overrun due to momentum
when trying to stop. Basically will I get more control and precision using
stepper motors and also will the
extra work involved with getting stepper working be worth the trouble in the
end run, or am I better off sticking
to DC motors



Any input, experiences, comments , would be appreciated

I'm sure that would be fine.  The important things seem to be the 9.6
volts and the relatively high current capacity that nicads provide.  The
larger the amp-hour rating, the longer you can go before recharging.

I encountered the same problem with the DC motors I use on my robot.
I used a reflective type encoder that read a black and white stripe of the
driving wheels, but did not work reliably due to
lack of resoulution and interference from ambient light.

I want to try to get some comercial quadruature encoders with a resolution
of min100 ppr. and give it a try.
The other problem that I encountered is that if one of the motors is slighty
slower then the other and you use diferential steering
it will arc towards the slower motor some sort of PID might also help.

If you decide to go the stepper way check out this homepage
http://www.cctc.demon.co.uk/stepper.htm

B.T.W. if you don't mind I would be interested in the code you used with the
saft encoder.

Thanks,

Hello, all:

    Just following-up on yesterday's message about the HB resetting during
the initial download.

    Removing the DS1233 and replacing it with a reset switch produces a
working configuration. There was also one stuck digital input, but swapping
the HC11 corrected that.

    How important is the DS1233? I know that it holds the HC11 in a RESET
state until the voltage stabilizes, but if the robot is under physical
control, I don't see a danger. Some sort of motor power interlock would do
the trick.

    But, since I'd like everything just so, does anyone have a spare DS1233?

Russell ,

     Having that encoder will help you a lot.  One of the biggest problems
with using steppers is that they will stall when you get to higher speeds.
What ever program you use to drive the steppers should have a part that asks
"has it made the last step?" before issuing the next step.
     I have a small line following robot using steppers that runs very slowly
since it does not have this feedback.  Your program will need to generate the
stepper timing, and if you do not use a "stepper driver chip" you will also
need to generate the stepper pattern.  These are not hard, but they will eat
into you program time budget a good bit.  I'd count on 30%-50% of your
software time just running the two steppers with feedback.  All the timer
features of the 6811 will help this a bit, but it will still call for a good
amount of attention.  The feedback might ease the limits on ramping that you
need to do.  If the encoders are an overriding part of your program you could
change your speed from 0 to max, and let the encoders do the ramping for you.
The only problem there is insuring the motors run at the same speed.
     If you use an external stepper driver chip, you will not need to generate
the step pattern.  If you are just using a simple current amplifier (I don't
think the Handy motor driver chips will give you enough current), you will
need to generate the steps in your program.  It is not hard to do the steps in
the program, you just have to do it.  I don't think your code will be too
different either way.  I would guess that you would set your timers to issure
a software interrupt when it is time for the next step.  So your code would
look something like:

TimeForNextStep:
    Did this motor take the last step (read encoder)
    Did the other motor take its step (if going straight)
    Issue next step (if external stepper driver this is just a pulse on a pin,
      otherwise you "look up" the next step from a step table in code space)
    return from interrupt

    Even with encoders you will need the timer to slow the motors down.  Your
software will need to ramp the speed down for stopping if you want the
position of the robot to be accurately known.  Steppers slow down faster than
they speed up.

Hope this helps

Robbie Berg and Capt. Jack Rutledge:

I'm a big fan of the Handy Board, but you might want to also consider usi=
ng a 3Com
PalmPilot.  The current model, Palm III, has a backlit 160x160 graphics d=
isplay, a
2MByte memory, and while I haven't used it, there is a company that makes=
 a GPS for
it.  I know that there are numerous real time mapping products out there =
already
that use the PalmPilot.

It sounds like your database of  "waypoints" would consist primarily of  =
a list of
X,Y coordinates, and be limited in area, so I would think that a database=
 on the
order of a few 100,000 waypoints could be stored in a Palm III.  And if y=
ou need
more memory there are lots of other handheld computers out there with gra=
phics
displays.

Since you are a pilot I'm sure you are familiar with GPS technology, but =
if you've
never used one for ground based applications you might want to also resea=
rch
"differential" GPS.  I would think that finding a hydrant hidden in some =
bushes
might require some very good resolution.  I've used GPS for hiking and fo=
r mapping
the location of trees and plants, so I know that the real world performan=
ce of *low
cost* GPS units on the ground can be very poor.  Some of the toughest pla=
ces for a
GPS to perform are in hilly, heavily forested terrain, but also in metrop=
olitan
areas with tall buildings and lots of potential noise sources.

This idea sounds very interesting, but I see 2 problems...

First, a GPS reciever doesn't actually contain a compass, so it cannot correctly
point you to another location while you are standing still.  To determine what
direction its facing, a GPS receiver must be MOVING.  It then compares its position
measurement from second to second, and using that information it knows where its
heading so it can report back to you which way to turn to get to your destination.
This should't be too much of a problem though, because with a good receiver once
you start briskly walking in any direction the receiver will very soon sync up with
your movement.  When I say a "good" receiver I don't necessarily mean an expensive
one... I chose a Garmin GPS 12 which is quite inexpensive because it offers no
frills yet it has all of the basics needed for accurate position and track
measurements.

The second problem might be a killer for you...  GPS receivers work by using
signals from orbitting sattelites operated by the U.S. Departement of Defence.
Although most publicly available GPS receivers are theoretically accurate to within
15 meters or better, the DOD deliberately introduces small error factors into the
sattelite transmissions to reduce the accuracy to about 100 meters.  This is called
SA (Selective Availability) and the DOD does it to ensure that no hostile force
uses the GPS system for weapons system targeting.  This makes a lot of sense, but
unfortunately it means that the GPS you use to try to locate your fire hydrant will
randomly have an error factor of up to 100 meters, which I fear could make your
system worthless.

Their is a possible solution to this 2nd problem, and it's called "Differential
GPS".  To understand exactly why this is necessary and how it works, I suggest you
read up on GPS fundamentals.  At www.howstuffworks.com (which I urge everyone to
visit, it's great) there is a very basic article on how GPS works, and it contains
links to sites with more details.  In particular,
http://www.trimble.com/gps/howworks/aa_hw1.htm gives a superb in depth explanation
of how GPS works.

Drew,

I just got through finding all of the stuff during the last 2 weeks:

B.G. Micro has the 68HC11 and the 32K static (great prices, too).

Newark has the Dallas Semi voltage monitor and the TI motor drivers ($20
minimum order). One other option that I didn't look into is that Dallas Semi
has a direct sales option on their web page for very small quantities. I
have no idea how cost effective this is, but it may be worth while looking
into if the Dallas Semi part is the only one you need from Newark.

Shack has a 40KHz IR detector. Looks like different pinout, but I plan to
mount on a cable, and it beats the minimum quantity 50 that Marshall is
showing for the Sharp part.

I substituted the Rohm 2065 LCD display (from Mouser) for the elusive
Hitachi part.

Mouser and Digikey have everything else, although some part numbers have
changed, and you may have to substitute equivalent parts for some
discontinued parts.

Jameco may have better prices, but I lost patience with their web interface.

Have fun!

Dave

Hi:

Has anyone ever worked with laser beams and making
handyboards recognise them? I think the wavelength
is around 600 nm but I haven't been able to come up
with a sensor which could recogonise the laser signal
alone and no other signal.

Hi All:

With a lot of help from you all , I am finally able to send out
a modulated signal from one HB which the other can recognize. :)
Now I am trying out obstacle avoidance using the IR. I tried to use
the standard ir_detect() function with the library. But I could not
get the LED to transmit anything. My guess is that my connections for 
the left and right ir output LED's are not correct ( I connected them to 
J6). And I could not understand where is the PE4 and do I have to connect
a detector to it or the Sharp chip is enough ( J7 )

So could someone explain the J6 connections to me properly? I mean, how to make
it into outputs?

Another question , has anyone done range detection using IR? I mean, the 
distance to the obstacle, depending on the intensity if the beam?

Thanks again.

Rajbala

Using a 'hacked' GPIU58X (see Novasoft website for acrobat file
describing changes required) you can get an analogue reading relating to
the distance from an object. The transmitting LED has to be modulated at
the correct frequency and should be mounted with the HB. The acrobat
file list the possible ranges as 0.5 to 44 inches, but this does require
some extra software control.
I haven't tried this myself but I intend to in the near future.

Hope this helps.

Hi John,

Just read your message about IR ranging. Do you have a site address as I
can't seem to find the site using a web search,
also what is the usual working range for standard IR collision detection as
I have been looking through some catalogs and they all have a couple of cm
at best, even IR proximity switches only go up to 5-10 cm and these are
seriously expensive.

cheers Russ.....

The GPIU58X is not an IR proximity switch but the hack provides an
analogue level relating to the intensity of the received signal.
Novasoft also sell the IR receivers (it's where I got mine from and I'm
based in the UK).
The address of Novasoft is :
http://www.mil.ufl.edu/novasoft/


As an extra piece of information, I remember somebody recently
mentioning the video capture used by Joker Robotics in Germany. When I
last checked their site (which was a fair time ago) the Quickcam robot
was actually using a 68000 based board mounted on a Hexapod chassis.
Their address is :
http://www.joker-robotics.com/


Hope this helps.

panel, can i charge this using a normal lead acid charger that normally
charges car batteries, If not what is the difference in cahrging methods
between lead acid and nicad as obviously the handy board wall plug charger
rated at 700mAh would not do the job.


Regards Russ.......

Hi all,

I just got my Tech America catalog in the mail (1-800-877-0072).

On the back cover they have this 'portable power' thing which just might be
able to be used for a robotics application...for only $30!!!

Here's the specs:

8 Amp Hour sealed lead-acid battery.
"Great for charging power tools or running portable TV's..."
8 hour charge from 110v AC or
3 hour charge from 12v DC.

I don't know anything about power supplies or power systems, but I am looking
for some external power source to use with the Handyboard and External Motors.

Do you think this will work?  
Anyone know what circuitry I would need to add to use this battery?
Could I just plug it into the terminals after making the external power supply
motor mod on the Handyboard?  Or, would that fry my HandyBoard?

Thanks

No.  You need to limit the current going through the nicad when you charge
it.  Typically it's some relatively small fraction the the current the
battery can supply.  Car battery chargers can supply a LOT of current.
Hooking a small nicad to a car battery charger would be a BAD idea.

Determine the ammount of current the nicad can handle, pick the
appropriate series resistor, and then you can use the 12V car charger.

From: Bill Bynum <bynum@CS.WM.EDU>

Hello, everyone:

   One of my students and I have been trying to get two HandyBoards
to talk to each other over their serial ports, but we are having
trouble.

   We first wired a 4-wire modular connector the way the FAQ says to.
No smoke -- a good sign.

   Then we used serialio.c (linked to on the FAQ) to create a
test program.

   The receiving robot never gets past the test of the data ready
bit of the SCSR location.  Moreover, when we comment out the wait,
apparently no data is being placed into the SCDR location in
the receiving robot.  These symptoms occur whether or not 
the sender and receiver call disable_pcode_serial() (and whether
reenable_pcode_serial() is called in there anywhere).

   Our 4-wire connector cable tests out OK with an ohmmeter.

   Does anyone have any suggestions of what we can try next?

   Has anyone had any success in getting two HandyBoards to communicate
through their serial ports?

   Oh, by the way, we're running the 2.82 (freeware) version of the
PCODE interpreter and ic.

   Thanks.

The HB wall plug charger MIGHT do the job, sort of...  Generally you need a
charger that makes about 15V under load to charge a 12V (nominal) battery
pack.

Do NOT use an auto battery charger unless you have a way to reliably control
the CURRENT to your battery.

Are you sure your security alarm panel battery is a NiCad and not a gell
cell?

Quick and dirty general charging rules:

NiCads:  Charge in 8 to 12 hours at C/10 amps where C is the capacity.
Thus, a 6AH NiCad pack would charge at 600MA.  Note that the charge voltage
should be several volts more than the rated pack voltage.
	   Generally, low cost OEM charger/battery combinations use C/20 to reduce
tha chance of damage to the pack.  Fancier ones charge at C/5 or faster, but
use some feedback (usually temperature, sometimes voltage or pack
resistance) from the pack itself to switch the charger to trickle mode when
the pack is full.  Reason: NiCads will tolerate a fast charge, but once full
they will overheat rapidly and vent or rupture if the current is not
reduced.
	   Conventioanl wisdom about NiCads is that they will lose useful capacity
if kept on trickle charge or repeatedly recharged before they are empty.
This "memory effect" is actually much less of a problem today than 10 or 20
years ago, but it is still a good idea to periodically run NiCads till dead,
than give them a long slow charge.

Lead/Acid:  Except for vehicle batteries, most lead/acid batteries today are
gell cells; no vents, no spill, but gell cells will not provide the very
high currents (or tolerate a very fast charge) like the battery in your car.
Gell cells can be charged at C/10, but C/20 is safer.  The big difference in
charging gospel for gell cells is that they should be kept on full  charge
all the time, recharged immediatly after any use, and it's a bad idea to run
them flat.  Most users store them on a C/20 or C/40 trickle charger all the
time.  Maintained this way, they can be counted on to provide full capacity
for years.  I suspect your security panel backup battery may be a gell cell.
It should run the HB just fine...

I have been using various boards (6.270, Handyboards and fingerboards) for

I am willing to use my handyboard from linuxPPC on my macintosh, so i
recompiled dl, ic and mon. It works fine with all my boards except the ones
that have 68HC11E1 instead of A1 controllers. I know that this is due to
the handling of the bootloader in dl and mon.

As i know that this problem has been solved for other ports (PC and Mac)
i'm looking for the changes to be done to the sources to handle the E1 as
well as the A1..... I'm ready to dig in the source code.

Subject: Monitoring household power consumption
References: <2bd01ba2.3648e283@aol.com>
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

In the interest of reducing my reliance on the commercial power grid for my
home's electrical power requirements I want to consider switching to more energy
efficient devices and to at least partial solar power or other alternative power
sources.

To make the proper decisions I am hoping to be able to use my HandyBoard to
monitor my total home power consumption in real time, and transmit the results
to my PC for further processing.  This would allow me to both measure the true
power consumption of individual appliances (by turning them on and off in a
controlled manner) and to get more general power consumption graphs showing the
peaks and valleys of my consumption throughout a day, week, month, or year.

I'm a software expert so I have no problems there, but I could use some help
from you hardware and electronic experts...

How can I actually monitor the true 120V AC power usage in a home running a
furnace, dishwasher, lights, and TV etc.?

One way I figure might be to install a sensor on the front of the glass of the
electricty meter to detect that little black band on the disc that spins round
and round, but that would have to be a pretty darned good sensor, no?

Another way might be to do something similiar to whatever it is that the
electric company does to measure the power, but I have no idea what that is so I
don't how to do that either.

Any suggestions friends?

Hi,

I was trying to use the digital inputs for my project.
Whether I ground the inputs, or I connect them to high,
a read from 0x7fff gives me "76". (My connections are
correct, as per your drawing in this mail archive).

I finally discovered, that in the slot where I should find a 74HC244,
my handyboard has a 74HC374N. Please let me know
what I need to do to use those inputs.

Thanks,

Do you want to measure the individual devices, or the whole house?

To do the individual devices you would have to have sensors right next
to the devices. To monitor each circuit in the house, you can put
sensors in the fuse box. To do the whole house, you can have a single
sensor where the power comes in the house.

There was an article in Circuit Cellar ink about 2 years ago on how to
do this. The sensors where a torroid core wrapped with wire.  The AC
induces a voltage into this coil.  I think the article had 5-10 wraps
of wire getting 0-5volts, so the analog port would give you the
inputs. 

Good luck.

Actually, that little black band is a relic of earlier days when people
(like myself) had jobs that occasionally required them to sit with a
stopwatch and count turns.  A slide rule was then used to calculate power
consumption.  Each meter had a unique "meter factor" which entered into the
equation.  You actually might not have such difficulty using an LED
emitter/detector pair to count turns if you shield the meter from ambient
light.  Of course, if you remove the glass dome to get closer to the disk
the power company will send the sheriff...

The problem with the meter disk is it only spins fast if you are using a lot
of power, so if you want to track individual small appliances you would have
to run them a really long time with everything else unplugged.  Remember,
many devices like TV's , radios, doorbells, stoves, ovens, HVAC, and
telephones, or anything with a built-in battery charger or clock, or
anything that runs from a "wall wart" (AC adapter), or anything that uses
refrigeration, or has a built-in microprocessor; will use power even when
shut off.  Just for the hell of it, turn off everything you can think of,
then take a flashlight and go watch that disk...

All of which is to say that finding the Circuit Cellar article referred to
by Tom Brusehaver is a good idea.  Presumably the article provides some way
to convert the coil output to DC.  You could also buy/borrow/rent a current
meter or current probe for your multimeter if you own one.  These use the
same principle, except the toriod is hinged so you can snap it over the hot
wire without having to disconnect anything.  You can then make a power
survey for each circuit in your house by snapping the meter over the
relevant wires in your breaker panel.  To run a long term survey for the
whole house you need to make and calibrate your own coils.  Note that if
your house is wired in the normal way you need two.

I purchased a power meter from Brand electronics.  They have a few 
different models.  There is one that is suitable for measuring the costs of 
one device and there is a larger one that has to be hardwired into your 
house.  Check out http://www.mint.net/~ebrand/
They are pretty nice little devices.

Right. If you're trying to do that, good luck!!! If I ABSOLUTELY had to do
that, I would try to use the reflectance of the disk. On the black spot I
would read zero. But it would be waaaay too much trouble.

Well the idea of putting a tore with some wire is one of my favorite idea.
Problems are:

1. the voltage output would have to be converted to DC throught a diode and
smoothed with some capacitors

2. the diode has some voltage drop, which you must take in consideration if
you want to take precise mesurements. If your goal is to get an overall
picture of your consumption, then if you read 0 with the handyboard, your
appliance may be completely off or using few amps (a CD player turned off
can still use 8 watts!)

3. if i had to do this, I would like to isolate the low voltage section and
the high voltage section... If something had to happen, I don't want my
handyboard to get fried.. maybe using some 1/8 fuses or less?

4. What the insurances would say if they knew you played around with your
electrical panel? ;) Do you have an electrician license?

5. Considering all this trouble, I think I prefer buying an amprobe and
keep my handyboard for controlling a stepper motor mounted on my vertical
stores =)

Cya!

Subject: Re: Connecting two HandyBoards through their serial ports 
Date: Thu, 12 Nov 1998 09:44:19 -0500
From: Bill Bynum <bynum@CS.WM.EDU>

Hello, everyone:

   Richard Drushel helped me solve the problem that I was having
in getting two HandyBoards to communicate through their serial
ports by suggesting that I check to be sure that the wiring on the
RJ11 cable I was using corresponded to a "null modem" connection.
Indeed, the connecting RJ11 cable I was using turned out NOT to be
a null modem cable.

   On the HandyBoard FAQ, the following question tells how to 
connect two HandyBoards:

> I want to plug two Handy Boards together so that they can
> communicate. What kind of cable should I use?
> 
>    For this application, you must use the network style RJ11 cable
>    (as described above). Do not use the normal telephone style
>    RJ11 cable used to connect the HB to the serial interface, or
>    you will suffer the smoke and burn consequences noted above.

   The question before this one in the FAQ -- "The R11 on my
Interface/Charger is smoking hot and is turning black! ..." --
describes a network-style RJ11 cable by saying that if you hold
the the ends of the cable plug-to-plug, both contact side up, the
wires line up as follows:

                     -------+    +--------
            ---------  black|    |yellow -----------
            ---------    red|    |green  -----------
            ---------  green|    |redn   -----------
            --------- yellow|    |black  -----------
                     -------+    +--------

   Wiring an RJ11 cable this way avoids smoking the power supplies
on the two HandyBoards, because the unswitched power leads of the
two HandyBoards are connected, the ground leads are connected, the
RxD leads are connected and the TxD leads are connected.

   Either the above diagram is wrong (I think that it's right,
actually) or the advice in the FAQ to use this kind of cable is
wrong, because it is necessary for the RxD and TxD leads on the
two HandyBoards to be swapped and the ground leads to be matched.
The unswitched power leads aren't needed for serial communication,
but if they are connected, then they have to be matched.  Namely, if
you wire your RJ11 cable so that when you compare the cable plugs
contact side up you get the pairings:

                     -------+    +--------
             --------  black|    |black   ------------
             --------    red|    |green   ------------
             --------  green|    |red     ------------
             -------- yellow|    |yellow  ------------
                     -------+    +--------

This wiring switches TxD and RxD, but matches up the unswitched power
leads and the ground leads on the two robots.

   When you use an RJ11 cable wired this way to connect two HandyBoards,
then the serialio.c functions implement serial communication between
the two HandyBoards quite nicely.

Gads Bill, you are right and my info in the FAQ is dead wrong.  I 
have updated the FAQ with the corrected information.

*Thanks a lot* for working this one through.  There are few things
more annoying than completely wrong documentation (compiler bugs maybe
are one of them).

Sure.  I wrote the attached program to keep my robot tracking in a
straight line (it used to arc across the floor).  It's not very elegant
code, but it works.  Note that some of the constants will need to be
tweaked for your particular application.  Hope this helps.  Good luck!

Thanks for the info and the code. got it.

But I need something like an implementation of Proportional-Integral Controller or  P-I-Differential Controller (Feedback
Control Loops), which we always see on any control books.

Thanks in advance.

Hi all,

Ok now i know how to charge my NiCad batteries i have laying around.

Thanks to Brett and Scott for the info.

I have been doing my sums to try and work out the series resistor i need to
charge a 2Amp NiCad at C/10, but my figures dont seem right.

Iam using an old laptop power adapter rated at 15V @ 4.4A, ok so here goes.

                                                     2A
charge current needed for nicad =   -------  = 200mA.
                                                     10

                                                   15volts
Resistor needed =                         ----------  = 75 Ohms
                                                     0.2A

power rating of resistor =                15Volts * 200mA  = 3Watts


Series resistor needed =                 75 Ohms @ 3 Watts.
                                                     -----------------------
-------
The 75 Ohms bit seems reasonable to me but 3Watts must be way to much.
could anyone show me where i have gone wrong.

Thanks Russ.

3 Watts is correct. Look at the resistor on the HB charger board.  It's
pretty hefty too.

greetings to all

i dont know if it has been asked before, but im trying to use son extra

but im trying to adapt the signals in the ranges of 0 to 50 volts, how 
do i make them proportional to the 0 to 5 V range?

You could use resistors to make a 1/10 voltage divider.

If you need high input impeadance,  you could build an Op-Amp circuit to
divide the voltage by 10.

Most ADC chips have a pin that is the reference voltage for the high end
of the scale--set this pin to 50V.  I think there is a pin on the 68CH11
that is a referece voltage for the ADCs, although I'm not sure it can go
to 50V.

Hi everyone,

The mistake you make in your calculation is that in your calculation you take
the entire 15V for the resistor and this leaves no voltage for charging your
NiCad.
Do the same thing again and deduct your NiCad voltage from the 15V you have
available for your charger and make sure that the voltage to charge your Nicad
is larger then the Nicad voltage.
You will end up with a smaller series resistor and also have a lower power
dump in that resistor.

Let me know what results you get.

Jan Bos

hi,
I need to know what is really the 'processing time' that used in encoder
especially used when a pulse is actually being recorded. 

I load the file "encoder.lis" into the standard lib file. I'm using a
optical encoder which is a slotted wheel. When the first pulse is detected,
the first number appear on the LCD
is 5 or 8. Why not 1 only since is only the first pulse detected ?

rgds,
phillip

Russ:
In a message dated 98-11-13 04:48:38 EST, you write:

<< ...
 power rating of resistor =                15Volts * 200mA  = 3Watts
 
 
 Series resistor needed =                 75 Ohms @ 3 Watts.
                                                      -----------------------
 -------
 The 75 Ohms bit seems reasonable to me but 3Watts must be way to much.
 could anyone show me where i have gone wrong.
 
  >>

    Your trouble with this is you have assumed the only thing across the power
supply is the resistor.  It is in series with the 12 Volt battery.  So for the
resistance you need:
     R  = (15 - 12) / 200mA = 3 / .2 = 15 Ohm

For power you can use either the 3 volts across the resistor times the .2 amps
through it, or the current squared times the resistance (E = I * R and P = E *
I ->
P = I * R * I = I^2 * R).
     Power = current squared times resistance = 0.04 * 15 = 0.6 W

     The only concern I would have here is verifying the 15V supply.  Take a
capacitor and place it across the output, turn on the supply and measure the
voltage.  I'll bet you get more than 15 (probably 19 or 20), which is the peak
voltage.  It's up to you if you use this new (peak) voltage, or stick with the
RMS.  Either way I would not leave the batteries in the charger more than 20
hours.  And touch them every now and then, if they feel warm, they're drying
out and that's nto good.

Good Luck
Pherd

Hi all,
    I found an interesting article by Don Lancaster in May 1998 issue of the
magazine,
Electronics Now.  Maxim makes a chip (MAX125) that will convert accurately
four 
channels of analog data to 13 bits accuracy, plus talk about a device for $79
that
stick to the glass of an ordinary power meter and then counts the black marks.
It
comes complete with software for the PC or MAC. 
    For bundle of home-energy management resources go to Don Lancasters web

robots?
Thank you,

Hi,=20

	I'm using the Polaroid 6500 ranging board with the sonar routines on =
the HB web site.  When I call the sonar on one HB it returns -1 but when =
I try it on another HB it works fine.   So it isn't the sensor. Could =
anyone tell me which conections on my HB would cause this result.  Would =
it be the SPI header(??).  I'm not too verse in electronics so any help =
would be greatly appreciated.

Thank You,
Peter

Subject: correct procedure when downloading pcode_hb.s19
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

hi
I am at present building a handyboard from Fred's assembly manual,
however it appears I might have a problem.

I have connected the serial interface board to the handyboard. The hb is
placed into bootstrap mode by holding down the stop button. The LCD
screen has one line of blocks displayed. The power plug pack is
connected to the s/i board to power the whole show.

I am using win95 (an early version) and hence use hbdl.

I download pcode_hb.s19 and a window appears telling me the monitor
program is downloading. Whilst this is happening the SER led on the S/I
board flashes and the PWR led on the handyboard flashes as well.

At the end of the monitor download program the yellow LED15Y led flashes
and the program download starts. Whilst this is happening again the SER
led flashes, however the PWR led remains on (no flashes).

At the end of the program download, nothing has changed on the LDC
screen, ie still a row of blocks. I switch off the power switch on the
handyboard and turn on the power switch to reset the board expecting to
see a prompt on the LCD screen. Alas still the same line of blocks on
the LCD screen greets me.

I am using the handyboard software downloaded from MIT.

Is this what is meant to happen or can anyone suggest the next step?

thanks in advance

Mobile Robots: From Inspiration to Implementation by  Joseph L. Jones,
Anita M. Flynn; 

As its title suggests, this book convers everything you need to know
to build a mobile robot. They discuss the design of their brain (a
MC68HC11 design that looks similar to the HandyBoard and 6.270 board,
yet is packed with sensors as oppossed to having connectors where you
roll your own like the handyBoard, this doesn't mean there are no
expansion capabilities, but it is designed to be fully stocked). It
also runs Interactive C.
  I strongly reccommend this book. It gave me a great introduction to
mobile robots and I often find myself referring to it while I play
with my HandyBoard.
Cheers,
  Chris Prosser

Subject: Which M68HC11 to use
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I am planning to build a HandyBoard, and am in the "Gathering Stage". I
just recieved the docs from Motorola; the "HC11 Reference Manual", and
the "MC68HC11A8 Programming Reference Guide". The Parts list for the
HandyBoard calls out for the MC68HC11A1FN.

The Reference Manual (in section 2.2.1) says the -A8 is the same as the
-A0 and -A1 except that the disabling of the internal ROM and/or EEPROM
is determined in the non-volatile config register.

Please let me know if I interpreted this correcly. I have NOOO HC11
experience!


Questions:

1. Will the -A8 as opposed to the -A1 work with the HandyBoard?
2. Has anyone adapted the HB for use with the HC11F1 or HC11K4?
3. Is the "FN" (in ref to the part listing) just a vendor code?

I am using the E1FN version myself without any problems (after getting
through some problems during implementation). I believe that the F
describes the type of package used (square version as needed on the
'standard' board).

  hi 

  i'm trying to use the handy-board to drive a 32V DC motor. a webpage at 
  the handyboard website showed that this can be done by cutting the 
  original power trace and simply plugging in a new external power 
  source(a 36V battery pack?).  

  what i would like to know is whether the handy-board can supply a 2.3A      
  current to the motor with the increase in supply voltage. however, it 
  seems that the existing L293D motor driver can only supply 600mA. does
  this mean i have to use a different chip with higher ouput current
  capability or even a separate motor driver board? if possible, could 
  someone please recommend a suitable motor driver chip other than the
  L293D? Thank you.

hi,
i really need help urgently. Currently, I running my robot using 2 DC motor
on port 2 & 3. I used external power supply to the L293D (pin 8). I did not
cut the trace. I used Alkaline battery 12V recharagable . when I run my
robot, it is running smoothly. However,  something went wrong. The port 3
for the left motor is not rotate anymore. 
I tried numerous debugging method to see what is the problem.

Firstly, the outcome of the problem is that the port 3 red LED (reverse) is
always turning on. When I used the command :

a) motor (3,50); ==>   red LED and green LED is light up
b )motor (3, -50); ==> red LED is light up. Green LED is not light up
the red LED is still turning on for both command . Not the green LED.
However, When I used command :  off(3) ;   the red LED on port 3 turned
off.

I tried to load the "hbtest.c"  and then type " testmotors( ); "  The
result is that the motor LEDS is begin to flash one at a time , beginning
with motor 0-green, motor 0-red, motor 1-green, etc. When it reach port3
green LED, the port 3 red LED turn on all the way without turning  off. The
red LED stay light up even though the rest of the LED is still flashing
orderly. The port 3 green LED is still can flash normally. NO damage. Only
the port 3 red LED has problem.

Moreover,  i pluck in the DC motor wires into the port 3, the motor is not
moving. The rest of the port is moving . 
 
Please help .Thank .

rgds,
phillip

you may have blown one of your L293D chips.

try swapping the two chips to see if the problem then migrates to
motor 1.  if it does, then you have blown an L293D.

there is more info on debugging motor problems in the FAQ.  See the
answer to "One of the motor outputs has stopped working" at

Madhu:

     I would be very surprised that you overcharged the batteries to the point
of no function.  Your batteries would have to have gotten very hot for that
time (batteries deteriorate in a charger due to evaporation of electrolite
water).  Generaly over charging weakens a cell (one battery in a pack) and
gives it a funny discharge characteristic.  No life at all means a broken wire
or trace.  Take the batteries out, start at the battery pack with an ohm meter
and check the circuit from the battery minus terminal to Ground; and the plus
terminal to: the 5V regulator, the supply for the memory chip, and the motor
supply.  When you find the bad spot, solder a wire bridge around the break,
and try to figure out why it blew before putting the batteries back.

      I would first suspect that the motor chip has blown.  This is eash to
check since the Handy board has two L293 chips.  Swap them (disconnect your
motor connections) and run testmotors().  If the problem follows the chips,
replace the bad one.  (You might want to buy a small stock of extra L293
chips.)  If the problem does not follow the chips, I would suspect the 68HC11
chip.  You will probably need an osciloscope to be sure, but start at the
inputs to the L293 and trace back to the chip to be sure of the signal your
getting.  (There is a 74374 and 7404 that you will need to check.  You will
find all this documented in the Handy Board Technical Reference manual.  See
page 49 for details on the motor drive.

Edmund,
I recently received 2 LMD18200 chips from National Semiconductor through their
free samples order (limit 2/day, 5/week). These chips deliver up to 3A
continous output, and up to 6A peak. They are ideal for driving DC/ Stepper
motors.
All the schematics for connecting these can be found in the FAQ section of the
Handyboard webpage. The motor routines included with IC are supposed to be
compatible with these chips.
Good Luck

Hi all,

    My name is Marcelo Manjon, and i've just finished my 1st. version of
my Micromouse Robot. However, since it had some aligment problems, i've
decided to use more 12 IR sensors, in order to help the robot to stay
aligned along the maze and, consequently, my aligment software code
routine has increased (all my code has about 4500 bytes). Since i'm
using Interactive C Version 2.8, every time i try to download the
software to my Handy Board , it says it does not have enough memory in
order to download all my software code to the Handy Board. I would like
to know if there is any way of increase the available memory for my
software( i don't use routines like printf and others ones, but it seems
they are all encapsulated in pcode.s19 file and i don't know how to take
them off this file). Is there any advantage concerning memory space in
Interactive C 3.1 ?

    If anyone has any suggestions, please help me..

Thank you very much.

Marcelo Manjon

There's an alternative to th4e L293D chip that fits the Handy Board.
This chip can supply 1A.  I know you need 2+ Amps but a common method 
adopted by some people is piggybacking two or more chips.  (You put one 
on top of another to allow the curent  to be divided between the separate 
chips.  Thus if you piggyback three, you should theoretically be able to 
supply 3A which is what you need.

I believe this chips is  the SN??? that you can look up in the Handyboard 
FAQ somewhere.

Just a quick note..

As i remember if you stack the SN??? chips to get the current rating you
also have to
piggyback a L293D as these incorporate the anti-spike protection diodes as
the others don't

=09Greetings,

=09We are using a LMD18200-based H-bridge circuit from
=09Wirz Electronics to drive our motors. We simply removed
=09a L293 chip from its socket and ran the signals (a short
=09distance) to the LMD18200 circuit.

Hi :

It is given in the standard ir_detect() routine that the
detector should be connected to PE4? Can anyone tell me 
what is PE4 ? Is it the same as analog input 4 ?

Thanks

I need for two HBs to communicate via the serial port.  I'm using the =
"network" style cable. With Randy Seargent's serialio routines and the =
code that is in the HB FAQ.  Please Help my project is due the Monday =
after Thanksgiving.  Any input would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks
Peter

This is the code on the transmitting HB: (basically the code in the FAQ)
void serial_putchar(int c)
{
   while (!(peek(0x102e) & 0x80));  /* wait until serial transmit empty =
*/
   poke(0x102f, c);  /* send character */
}

void printdec(int n)
        {
        int leading_digit=3D 0;
        int dig, div;

        if (n =3D=3D 0)  {
        _printnum(0);
        return;
        }
                =20
        if (n < 0)  {
        serial_putchar('-');
        n =3D 0 - n;
        }
                 =20
        for (div=3D 10000; div=3D div/10; div> 0) {
        dig=3D n/div;
        n=3D n - dig*div;
        if (dig || leading_digit) {
        _printnum(dig);
        leading_digit=3D 1;
        }
    }
}

/* prints digit from 0 to 9 over serial line */
void _printnum(int n)
{
serial_putchar(n + '0');
}

/*To start a new line on the serial output, use:*/=20

void newline() {
 serial_putchar(10);
 serial_putchar(13);
}

void main(){
newline();
while(1){
printdec(5);
}
}

This is the code on the recieving HB:
void disable_pcode_serial()   /* necessary to receive characters using =
serial_getchar */
{
   poke(0x3c, 1);
}

void reenable_pcode_serial()   /* necessary for IC to interact with =
board again */
{
   poke(0x3c, 0);
}

int serial_getchar()
{
   while (!(peek(0x102e) & 0x20)); /* wait for received character */
   return peek(0x102f);
}

int main(){
disable_pcode_serial();
while(1){
printf("\n%d", serial_getchar());
sleep(.05);
}
}

Subject: Re: 32V DC Motor

While on the subject of motors and H-bridges.  I recently ordered a L298
based motor controller kit from JCM Electronics.

Unlike the L293, the L298 supports breaking and has two bits for
direction and one enable bit.  It would be easy to add use an inverter to
generate the extra direction bit, but breaking sounds like it could be a
useful feature, so I would like to be able to support it.
 
The the standard PWM code should work just fine for strobing the enable,
all I would have to do is find two extra output pins and hack on the way
the PWM code sets the direction.
 
I only need two motors, so I was thinking about removing both L293s and
stealing the direction bits from channel 2 and 3.  I need the SPI so those
pins are not available.  What would you guys recommend?
 
Is breaking really worth it, or should I just get an inverter?

Hi all

This is a list i compiled when building my handyboard. I found some parts
Quite hard to find and spent a lot of time reading through catalogs etc. So
i
thought it might save someone a lot of time. The list is pretty much
complete
and i now have a fully working handtboard but please double check it if your
gonna
order stuff using the part numbers in case of typos.


cheers Russ

One of the 1K resistor packs where wrong when i came to fit them. I Cant =
remember off hand which
one it was but i ordered all commoned supply type when one of them =

resitors. I got round this by using my left over 1k resistors.

Apart from the few notes above my board took 2 evenings to build and =
worked perfectly.....

Hi Peter,

There was recently a discussion on the list where it was revealed that
the network style cable does NOT work to connect to HB's together.

If you go back to the FAQ there will now be correct instructions for
making a cable to link two HBs.

Fred

In your message you said:
> I need for two HBs to communicate via the serial port.  I'm using the "networ
k" style cable. With Randy Seargent's serialio routines and the code that is in
 the HB FAQ.  Please Help my project is due the Monday after Thanksgiving.  Any
 input would be greatly appreciated.

The platform in question was based on the 'Hercules' r/c car that is
available at some of the FAO Schwarz stores.  This platform appears to be
identical to what was used by the USC entry in the 1997 Robo Cup
competition.  Clem (ctaylor@SRTC.COM) has purchased one of the kits, and was
interfacing to the internal H-bridge.  I have not heard anything further of
the progress.  There are a few pictures of USC's entry on the following
pages:

Hope this helps!

What is the battery voltage?  Does it work with a different battery or
DC adapter?

Hi all,

I have a miniboard I built recently that won't go into download mode.
In the note called "mb-debug.txt" on ftp://Cherupakha.media.mit from
Chuck McManis he describes the exact problem I have.

"If the RED LED light ups, or the motor LEDS flicker, then you are
probably not in download mode.  This can be caused by a defective
run/download switch or an open connection on the 5V pin of the switch."

The switch checks out O.K. and I have 5 V on the first pin.  The third
pin is ground as it should be and the center pin connect to MOBD on the
6811 chip.

Does anyone have other suggestions??  (sorry this is not handyboard)

Check the voltage at the MOBD pin on the chip (not the socket, not the
bottom of the board).  If it is 5V with the switch in the one
position, and ground (0V) in the other position, you may have a
defective chip.  Otherwise I'd guess open solder.

A gell cell battery is charged via a maximum allowed charging voltage.  If
the charger doesn't limit the charging voltage to less than 14 volts it
will shorten the life of a 12v gell cell considerably.

A Ni-Cad uses a constant charging current, but the voltage can easily get
up to 18v.  I'm sure you can find more technical information on the
subject, but I suggest not exceeding a 14v limit for 12v gell cells.

Most any battery wholesaler would be able to provide you with specific
information.  You can find them in the yellow pages under 'batteries,
commercial, wholesale'.

Rajbala,
       PE4 is the 3rd pin on the 68HC11. Just by looking at the schematics
in the HB manual I would think that it probably does connect to analog input
4.

Just a quick anecdote about Gel-Cells.

     I have a small and useless robot that simply rolls around on the floor
and bumps off things.  The motors are powered by a small Gel-Cell.  I had run
it that day and run the motor batteries flat, so I rigged a simple charger (a
transformer and bridge rectifier), hooked it up and a couple of hours later
left the house.  A few more hours I came home and found a strange smell in the
air.  After about 15 minutes investigating, I recognized the smell as sulfer.
I found the battery hot and bubbling.  I said to myself that I'm going to have
to get another battery, this one is toast.  Well that was four months ago, I
flipped on the robot yesterday and the motors came up to full speed.  The
battery has kept its charge for all this time.  I do not know what the drain
life of the battery is, but I didn't know what it was before I cooked it
either.
     I just wanted to say I'm surprised at how robust these little guys are.

Subject: Sharp IS1U60 availablity

I'm looking to purchase about 12-15 IS1U60s to use as optical bump sensors
and I'm having trouble finding someone that has them in stock and doesn't
want $5.50 for them.

Sterling Electronics, 781-938-6200, sells the part for around $1.75, with
a $25 min order, but they don't have any in stock and don't expect to get
parts until sometime in Feb.

A few other companies had them in stock but they had a minimum quantity of
100 units.

Any ideas who I can try?

How about a replacement of the IS1U60, which you can find in JAMECO

Part No. 106382 or Part No. 131908
Though a little bit expensive.

hi,
I have a big problem. I followed the method of yours that just lift up pin
8 of one L293 
and wirewrapped it. The positive supply is wirewrapped to pin 8 . How about
the negative supply of the batteries should insert or wirewrapped? I
inserted the negative supply in the bottom row of digital input as ground
together. 
Suddenly. after a short while, the L293 turn so hot. It burnt my hand.
Besides, the socket on the HD mounted with pin 4,5,12,13 of L293 has melted
in that particular area. Simply it is a plastic part. What is really
happens ?

Should I also wirewrapped the negative supply to one of the grounding point
pin of L293 ? By the way, If I cut the trace on HD, is it only cut the
trace to the positive supply only . How about the negative supply trace ?
should I cut? BEsides, If I cut, it there any way to mend it back to
originally ?

MOST IMPORTANTLY, Where should I cut ? Please show me the path? My proect 
jam down here. I really in a rush to complete and submit the project .
thank you very much . Please reply asap.

rgds,
phillip

below. It is the 7404 is damaged .What causes it? Any ideas?

RIght now this problem that melted my socket on the L293, the supply I used
is 12V supply to my 2 DC motors. I'm using Grandcell rechargable alkaline
batteries. Each is 1.5v.
The measure current is about 700mA.

Hi all,
I am dividing 4.1 by 4.1 in following manner and getting answer 2.
instead of 1.
Dividing 4.2 by 4.2 give 1 result, dividing 4.6 by 4.6 again give 2.
Except 4.1 and 4.6 rest all numbers give 1 result. I am using IC 3.2. Any
help in this regards would be appreciated.

void main()
{
float a;
a=4.1/4.1;
printf("%f",a);
}

Thanks
Javaid Iqbal

  Check B. G. Micro 800-276-2206 www.bgmicro.com  I would not be too concerned
with the actual part number, just look for an Infared sensor or remote control
sensor.  Also get the pin outs as these may be different.
    Also have you considered using fewer sensors and selecting which LED is
flashing to determin where the wall is located.  This might be cheaper.

Hope this helps

In a message dated 98-11-19 21:05:04 EST, you write:

<< hi,
 I have a big problem. I followed the method of yours that just lift up pin
 8 of one L293 
 and wirewrapped it. The positive supply is wirewrapped to pin 8 . How about
 the negative supply of the batteries should insert or wirewrapped? I
 inserted the negative supply in the bottom row of digital input as ground
 together. >>

  The negative supply attaches to ground and the pins on the digital I/O port
are fine, looks like nice thick traces to me.


<< Suddenly. after a short while, the L293 turn so hot. It burnt my hand.
 Besides, the socket on the HD mounted with pin 4,5,12,13 of L293 has melted
 in that particular area. Simply it is a plastic part. What is really
 happens ?  >>

[[Attached from the previous mail, I have already solved the problem listed
below. It is the 7404 is damaged .What causes it? Any ideas? ]]

     I don't know why your 7404 went bad, but I can see why that might cause
trouble for the L293.  I also don't have spec sheet on the 293.  Anybody know
what happens to a 293 if both inputs are turned on at the same time?  (Just
turns on both outputs so no motor motion, right?)
     Sounds like you are drawing too much current.  The 293 chips can be piggy
backed to switch more current.  The pins you mention are the ground pins for
the chip.  Most motor driver chips use the middle pins for grounding and LOW
LEVEL cooling.  Inside the plastic, the silicon is mounted on a wide piece of
metal, the same width as these pins.  This metal strip is cut to the shape of
the pins outside the plastic body.  The idea is if this is soldered to a big
fat ground plane on a printed circuit board, it can disapate some heat.
Probably ehough heat to keep the part from distroying itself at the rated
current.  As socket does not conduct heat like a solder joint, and even if it
did the Handy Board does not have a ground plane to spread the heat out.  In
the near term I strongly suggest that you glue some metal to the top of these
chips.  I've seen penneys used, slugs from electrical socket boxes.  If you
use glue, you might think of getting some heat sink compound in between the
metal and the top of the chip.  They make special heat sinks that clip around
chips of this size you might look for.

 <<Should I also wirewrapped the negative supply to one of the grounding point
 pin of L293 ?By the way, If I cut the trace on HD, is it only cut the
 trace to the positive supply only . How about the negative supply trace ?
 should I cut? BEsides, If I cut, it there any way to mend it back to
 originally ?>>

     On the component side to the left of the word START is a wide trace.
This is the trace that elads from the switch (batter), to the motor supply
pins.  Cut this trace and plug the other motor supply at the + and - connector
(which is above and to the right of the STOP swtich).  If you cut exactly in
the middle of exposed trace with a small gap (any gap is enough), you could
repair the trace by scraping the green solder mask from the remaining trace
and bridging the gap with solder and a little wire.    See page 56 of the
Handy Board Technical REference to see this trace easily.  If you are really
thinking of repairing this modification, I would really just consider using
the lifted pin.  It is much simpler to impliment and recover from.  I would
not go back and forth too often with either method.  Folding the pin up and
down will make it fall off, heating the trace too often will cause it to
delaminate (come off the board).
 
Hope this helps

hi,
I came to know that the power expansion can be used on J13 ( 1x4 pin jack).
However, 
why there is a 2 positive holes and 2 negatives on this header? If i'm
using a pair of DC motor 12V each, and i supply a 12v alkaline or NIMH
rechargable batteries, can i just insert only a positive and a negative
wire to the holes only instead 4 holes on the pin jack ? What is the
significant of having 2 positive holes and 2 negative ?

rgds,
phillip

Hi,
I knew that the analog expansion header in connected to the PE0 to PE3. How
should I call the analog command ? For example, 

 if  ( digital (11) ==1 )
     .................
or   
 
if (analog (3) ==1 )
  ....................

Hence, how should I use to apply into writing a program using PE0 to PE3 ?

Call 1-800-453-4652 for a Lego Shop-At-Home catalog.  They have an
assortment called #5229 Gears & Differentials for $4.50, that has all
but the huge 40-tooth gears.  Shipping is free.

If you need the 40-tooth gears, you can get four of them along with
twelve of the 24-tooth gears from Pitsco Dacta (1-800-534-6784).  Ask
for part number 779966, Large Gear Wheels ($6.75 + s&h).

Lego Shop-At-Home *might* also have the large gear wheels, but they're
not in the catalog.  Still, I've been able to get stuff that's not
listed by asking for a specific part number.  See if they have #9966
(the last four digits of the Pitsco number).  Good luck!

I wrote code so that you can call many motors in one statements. e.g.
fd2(0, 3);
is the sames as:
fd(0);
fd(3);

The syntax is:
fd(number of motors)(motor1, motor2);

so to call four motors it would be:
fd4(0, 1, 2, 3);

It's not the greatest code but I wrote it just for my use but I thought 
mabey someone elsewould like it.  You can also used it with bk(), off(), 
and motor().
The syntax for motor() is:
motor2(motor1, power1, motor2, power2);

if there are any problems with the code e-mail me,  or if you would like to 
add to it be my guest.
Too bad we weren't using C++ because you wouldn't need different function 
names for every different number of motors.  Just add this code to the end 
of the lib_hb.c file:

hi Fred,
Why there is 2 holes each for the positive and negative supply on the pin
jack (J13)?
I thought that just insert one hole each for the positive and negative
supply only. I need to know why the J13 is designed for 1x4 holes before i
decide to cut the trace.
Is there any special requirement for power expansion for motor that i need
to use 4 holes instead of 2 holes ?
If I use 2 holes only( positive and negative) what will happen ?
I supply 12v rechargable alkaline batteries to 2 DC motor.
There is no explanation in the archive why the J13 is design with 4holes (
2 for positive & 2 for negative).pls help.
Thank. I need to hear from you asap. 
rgds,
phillip

to make the connector more physically and electrically stable.

of course, only 2 connections are needed to make a ckt.

you should figure up to several amps of current flow.

it should work fine.  good luck.

Hello,
I have finished building Matt Harlan's H-Bridge circuit (from the Handyboard
FAQ) and I have come across the following instructions:

 "Make sure the supply ground for the 18200's is connected to the HB ground.
You'll get some very strange results if you don't.  Use the motor supply
header on the HB for this connection.  You can take advantage of the noise
filtering of the HB that way."
"The motor control routines in IC are completely compatible with the 18200's.
The enable lines for the HB motor chips go to the PWM line on the 18200's.
The direction lines from the HB go to the direction line on the 18200's.  
HB pin 1 to PWM motor 1
HB pin 2 to direction motor 1
HB pin 9 to PWM motor 2
HB pin 10 to direction motor 2"

First, does this mean that I should connect the HB ground to the 30VDC ground
I'm using to power the motors?
Second, the does the pinout given above refer to the motor ports on the
handyboard? If so, there is no connection on pin 2, and pins 9 and 10 refer to
two different motors!?
Thanks in advance for any advice.
Dave

Okay, this may seem silly, but I've got a very basic question.  

Just received a new handyboard (assembled, ready to go from Gleason).  After
charging it up, installing the pcode and booting all works fine.  The
'Interactive C' text shows on the screen.  I can run IC and use the beep()
functions and such.  Most other functions seem to work as well.  But, I
cannot get it to do a printf command.  If I try, it sits at the 'Downloading
X number of bytes,  X loaded' prompt and never returns.  It does seem to
download the code segment, just gets stuck doing it.  What am I doing wrong?
The hardware appears fine, as the display does show the IC welcome screen.
Is there some other special library you have to use?  At the startup of IC,
I show the following libs being loaded:

ic/libs/lib_hb.lis
lib_hb.c
ic/libs/r22_ir.lis
ic/libs/r22_ir.icb
ic/libs/r22_ir.c

I'm still not sure what caused the problem, but a new bootstrap/reinstall of
the pcode seems to have fixed the problem.  I can now successfully use the
printf function.  Odd though, that that was the only command that wasn't
working correctly.

	As far as connecting the grounds, that just means that the HB and the
motors must share a common ground.  The H-bridges need to reference the
direction and PWM signal to ground and if that ground reference is not the
same as the HB's the motors flip out.

	I used the motor power header for the gorund so that the motor supply
ground runs throught the on board choke before it get's to the digital
ground on the HB.  Motor are noisy and can cause the HB to reset.

YES.

It's been awhile since I had the HB out, but if memory serves me, those
should be right.  The connections are from the chip sockets for the on
board h-bridges, to the 18200.  

after checking the schematics, the connections are right.  Pin 1 on the
L293 serves as the PWM input to the 18200, and Pin 2 is the direction.  Pin
2 should be a direction connection from the '374 latch on the HB, and Pin 7
is its complement via an inverter.  Are you sure pin 2 is not connected?

I used a 16 pin DIP header for a ribbon cable to get the connection.  Pin 1
and 2 on the L293 socket to one 18200 and 9 and 10 to the other 18200.
Pins 9 and 10 should be setup the same way as pins 1 and 2.  

I'm not sure if that clears things up even a little.

if not, tell me exactly what is connected and what isn't working, and we'll
go from there.

good luck

matt

I've asked for help with the floating point bugs in IC before, and nobody
seems to care.  Unfortunately, I've come to not use IC floating point
variables at all, since I can't trust them.  It's all very frustrating since
none of the IC versions support long int division either; which also
seriously cripples the use of IC for precision fixed point calculations.

Later,

if you are not trying to divide numbers of great precision(many significant
figures), then you can try multiplying by some order of 10, performing your
division, then dividing by that same order of 10.  i have used this before, but
not for the same reason that you would be.  i was having a serious truncation
problem while incorporating PID code.  it worked for me...  but i think that
your case, fraction truncation can be unpredictable.  in any case, getting rid
of the fractions would be a solution.  good luck.

Hi all!

I am using the handyboard as a PID controller. I wrote my own program it didn't
perform really well.

Is there any resource about PID using HB so I can furnish my program?

Thanks a lot!!

Yes, you are right.  But I think this should be address by the software

Thankyou for your kind response to my student Javaid Iqbal on errors in
using floating point divide within IC software.  The errors have
effectively brought our use to a full stop at present because we cannot
rely on results nor bypass what has become a random occurance of the
error.  Would you know of anybody who can fix the bug or a different

have a few problems.  these problems were not in another version that i
had on disk.  the problems are:  there are no stop_button(),
start_button() functions, only left_button(), and right_button(), which
cannot be used (i tried).  and the analog() functions return 255 all the
time.  i am not sure about the digital functions, or anything else for

Subject: Building an IR/ultrasound co-processor... (LONG)

Hi,

I'm in the process of building a combination IR and ultrasound
co-processor for my HandyBoard based robot.  It's based on what Chuck
McManis did for his Cougar bot.  My version will have forward and backward
looking IR and include the sampling and filtering for two Polaroid 6500
ranging modules (also forward and backward looking).

I'm in the parts acquisition and planning phase right now and was hoping
to bounce some of my ideas off the list prior to placing an order with
DigiKey for the last of the parts.

I'm planning on using the PIC16C77 because it has 2 CCR pins (ranging),
SPI (communication with HandyBoard) and plenty of IO pins.

Rough layout:

  \ | /
-   *   -    Each of the lines represents a Sharp IS1U60 and a
             QEC233QT (\/-) or F5F1QT (|) pair.
-   *   -
  / | \      * = ultrasound transducer                       (base is 8x10in)

http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~ctaylor/gort_layout1.gif (a better picture)

Questions:
   1) DigiKey doesn't sell the TPIC2701, any ideas on a replacement part
   that DigiKey sells (I need 10 channels total)?

   2) The IS1U60 datasheet has a 47 ohm resistor on the 5V supply and a
   47uF cap between 5V and ground with a note that this should be as close
   as possible to the sensor.  I was planning on running ~10in long wires
   from the PICProto to the IS1U60 and the IR LEDs, is this going to be a
   problem?  Do I need separate resistor/cap pairs for each sensor/led
   pair or can I just connect all the 5V and ground lines in parallel?

   3) The PICProto64 sheet shows C3 and C4 as polarized caps, for this I
   would want to use tantalum caps?

   4) Should the MCLR pullup resistor (R2) be 100 ohms?

   5) Where can I find a cheap (but not to slow) EPROM eraser?  We have a
   really nice programmer at work, but we don't use EPROMs so we don't
   have an optical eraser...

In case anyone cares, heres my current part list:

Hi all,

have somebody experience with the Sharp GP2D02 IR-Distance Sensor. It=B4s
a nice and
cheap Sensor.

I plan it to connect via the SPI connector on the handyboard, but today
i have problems with
the timing.

Greetings

Subject: Intermittend IC floating point divide problem


Dear Richard and Javaid,

I have assigned a programmer to track down the floating point divide
problem, and will keep you posted on its resolution.  We believe it is a
problem with the floating point library that is assembled into the pcode,
so it is likely we should be able to release a new version of the pcode
with a fix to the problem.

Somebody already did part of the job. If you go to http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~jonh/robots/skguide.html you can download a pcode source for a road warrior kind of robot with some "corrections to the floating point math library to produce correct results for several previously buggy operations".

I haven't looked at it yet but it might be interesting to you or your programmer assigned to the task. Poor guy! I'll recommend a good read of the The Art Of Computer Programming; Fundamental Algorithms by Donald E. Knuth (Do not forget to get the errata from his Web site: there is a bug in his division algorithm).

Hi, I need to send and receive IR signal (not from remote controller) in
the
Handyboard
1.- Could  someone tell me what kind of routines I must use???

NOTE: I am not interested in getting codes from a RC, but also signal
to proccess differents intensities.

2.- The HB has an own IR receiver, I bought two more IR sensors,
Must i connect them to the digital port 0,1,2,3 ????

Thank you
John

Subject: pcode 3.2 beta 1 with FP divide fix


Hi all,

With Jon Howell's help, we now have available a new version of IC pcode	
which fixes the intermittent floating point divide problem.  The divide
problem was caused by a bug in the floating point library used by the
pcode.

The pcode works for IC 3.1/3.2, and is currently considered beta-test
status.  If you'd like to download and try it, please get it from:

ftp://newtonlabs.com/pub/pcode-fp-fix

pcode_hb.s19:  Pcode 3.2 beta 1 for Handy Board
pcode_rw.s19:  Pcode 3.2 beta 1 for Rug Warrior
pcoderwp.s19:  Pcode 3.2 beta 1 for Rug Warrior Pro

Instructions for installation:

Please make a copy of your currently working pcode and then replace with
the appropriate pcode from our ftp site.  Then redownload your pcode.  The
bootup message should state "IC 3.2 beta 1" if you have successfully
installed the new pcode.

If you download the new pcode and try it, I'd really appreciate if you
could send mail to ic@newtonlabs.com letting us know if it worked, or
especially if something didn't work.  We'd like to get the pcode out of
beta and into our main distribution as soon as possible.

Thanks for your feedback, and we apologize for the bug.

-- Randy

Hi Rajbala,

in germany i can get this sensor from "Conrad Electronic". The Sensor is
produced from Sharp.

It is a very interesting sensor, because it is cheap (ca. 16,00$)
It is possible to measure distances between 8-80cm, with a accuracy from =
round
about 1cm up to 10cm (Distance above 60cm). You get
the distance coded into a 8Bit word.

My software interface (Assembler) worked not properly, i think i have tim=
ing
problems with the device.




The GP2D02 is a "Position sensitive detector =3D PSD" it works like
triangluation and measure with short ir pulses.

For more information see:  http://www.xs4all.nl/~jwasys/gp2d02.html

good luck and i hope somebody can help

Hi John,

It depends on what kind of circuit your infrared sensors are in.  An
infrared diode or transistor can not be hooked directly into the HB.
They have to be biased properly and the signal amplified to be
compatible with either the digital or analog inputs.

One way of getting useful information from your pair of sensors is to
bias your raw sensors properly. For small targets at large distances,
find a set of lenses from Edmund Scientific to focus your target image
on the IR sensor.  The formulas for computing the focal lengths needed
are in most basic Physics texts.  IR will focus like visible light
except the focal length changes by a factor n because of the different
frequency of light.  Then find two sets of three tubes (any material
durable enough for the project)that will tightly slide over each other
and are twice the focal length you will be using.  Mount the large lense
in the middle of the big tube.  The other lense in the end of the second
tube.  And the infrared sensor at the end of the smallest tube. A hot
melt glue gun works well.  

Make or find two small ferrous (iron based) metal enclosures to mount
the sensors in.  Cut a round hole just large enough to allow the focused
diameter of the IR light in. Position the IR sensor at a known distance
from the front of the metal enclosure, but try to make the angle of the
focus less than 45 degrees so that the sensor is mounted a short
distance from the hole.  Again hot melt will secure it nicely if the
metal is coarse sand papered first.  Mount the IR detector casing in the
center of the end of the smallest tube (i.e. the focus of the lenses).
Use a small length of triaxial cable to interface the IR sensor with
your buffers/amplifiers.   Use the triax shield to ground the IR sensor
metal enclosure.

Reasons:  The ferrous enclosure is desirable because IR detectors are
sensitive to electric fields and they will give false readings.  The
sourse IR intensity drops with the square of the distance.  Therefore
lenses increase the range of a sensor significantly and help to
positively identify the position of the target.  If a broader field of
view is desired at short ranges, the lenses can be omitted.

To electronically interface the sensors.  A single source non-inverting
op-amp can be used to tie directly into the Handy Board.  This will
allow a gain adjustment to get whatever deviation you want from the
signal.

And/or feed each sensor into a differential op-amp with offset control
to monitor the difference between the sensors.  If you are using two
sensors, I'm guessing this is the signal you want anyway.

Good luck in your experimentation,

James Dunn

This is kinda off the HB topic, sorry.

How do you control the individual output states of the parallel port pins?

I'm working with some students where they must use a parallel port to 
control the states transistors and chips that ultimately control a robot.

Is there some simple C function or VB, etc. that will let you set the output 
states of the individual pins?  They need to control 8 pins.

Thanks for any leads.  :)

Hi Sargent,
I have successfully downloaded the new version of pcode. I received the
bootstrap message "IC v3.2 beta 1". I have done the arithmatic operations
and got accurate answers.
I would like to thank all those you helped me in solving this problem by
taking personal interest. 
I would like to thank Mr Randy Sargent, Fred Martin and jon Howell for
their special help.

Here's the HB 2.81 pcode  with  floating point divide fix.  This new FLTDIV
routine  was giving to me by Jon Howell.  I just patched the original math
library with it and recompiled the pcode.  I'm pretty sure this is the same
fix that Newton Labs is using.  I'm currently testing the recompiled 2.81
version of the pcode and haven't seen any problems yet.   Please email me
if you see any bugs.  I did not change the HB start up message so make a
backup copy of your original version of the pcode.

If anyone is interested in the RugWarrior pcode version or a version with
the new Smooth PWM drivers, let me know and I'll compile those and put them
up.   

You can download a copy from my web site

Hi,

Does anyone know how to print messages to the host computer while running
IC.exe using "printf" statement. Currently, when printf is executed, it
print to the LCD.

Is it true that the handy board can only work when the LCD is plugged onto
the handy board ? It is because when ever it unplugged the LCD from the
handy board, the host computer losses synchronization with the handy board.

Thanks for helping...

Hi,
I need additional port for the analog input. I have used up 7 analog ports
and 9 digital ports.  Hence, I need additional port from the HD. I came to
know that there are 4 extra analog port on the HD just above the analog
port 0 to 3. These additional ports are connected to PE0 to PE3 . HOW
should i command these ports to receive the input signal ? Eg,  if
analog(3) <127 {........}. Then, How should I use such command for PE0 to
PE3 to operate on the HD?

Besides, Is there any way to expand the input for the usage of digital port
since the 9 digital ports i have finished used up ?


rgds,
phillip

these aren't actually additional ports.  if you look at the PCB wiring
you'll see that they're just connected to regular inputs 0-3.

these extra connectors will be used by the expansion board.  please
look for an official notice regarding the exp board before the end of
November!

Subject: Re: How to use the addition analog port ?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

You can time share both your digital and your analog so long as your signal
update speeds are not critical.

Use a 4 to 8 demultiplexing chip for 4 of your digital I/O and an 8 to 4
multiplexer for the other 4.  This effectively provides 8 digital inputs
and 8 digital outputs.  Extra assembly language needs to be done to encode
and decode the respective signals.  I'm sure there is a memory efficient
way of doing this.  The increased update times should be relatively minor
depending upon the programming technique used.

For more analog I/O, take one or more of the digital outputs and switch
banks of analog signals to the analog inputs you have through solid state
relays (there are IC chips made for this purpose with 8 bi-directional
channels on a single chip).  You can select each of the analog ports as
either inputs or outputs independently for each bank by associating the
setup with the particular multiplexed digital output. For signals that need
to be monitored more frequently, they can be tied in to more than one bank,
or you can sacrifice the number of analog channels and use some of your
multiplexed digital inputs for interrupts to get immediate attention.

If all of the digital I/O is used to select analog I/O, you could monitor
or transmit 2 to the 8th times 8 standard analog plus 4 SP0 analog, or 3072
mixed analog inputs/outputs.  And these can be used for digital inputs as
well by doing a comparison (ie >127 is a 1) of the registers for inputs and
selecting 255 for 1 or 0 for zero for digital outputs.

Keep in mind though that the update time increases only for each bank of
analog that you setup and select.  Another way of increasing your update
rate would be selecting those banks that need shorter update times more
often and conditionally looking at others.

There are other methods of bank switching analog and digital signals that
could allow hundreds of billions of I/O, but the above implementation is
relatively straight forward to understand and implement.

I've had good results using the Hall-effect magnetic sensors that
Patrick Hui sent with my HandyBoard.  I glued magnets into three of the
six holes in a Lego pulley wheel and glued the sensor into a small Lego
brick.  I don't know the part number, but I'm sure that the usual
sources (Digikey, Mouser, etc.) probably have similar items.  Good luck.

hy,
I used HewlettPackard shaft encoders HEDL5540 (500 steps per revoltion)
with HCTL2020 quadrature shaft counters/decoders. With them you get
500*4=2000 steps per revolution, which is quite a lot. For me They seem to
be a good (but not cheap) solution. I know that other members of the
mailing list are also using them.(You can find them in the mailing list
archiv)
I haven't done it yet but the software part seems to me more problematic.
You will have to use sin and cos functions, and therefore the lack of
precision may not only come from your encoders but from your software since
errors add up. It's also CPU time consuming.
I will work on this part during the chrismas hollidays. Meanwhile, if you
are able to achieve a good positionning system, don't hesitate to tell me...

Bye 
Francois

We're using a track drive system and we're going to be using L.E.D.
proximity sensors off of the teeth of the track gears.  The tank tracks
appear to be very stable but it's still too early in the development to
know how repeatable the robot movements are going to be.

Although the knowledge of how far the robot has moved is of some
importance, the algorithms I've been reading about only need an
approximation for mapping the surrounding environment.

The two basic approaches are (1) a bitmap, and (2) a list of obstacle
coordinates.

A bitmap is just a grid of 1's and 0's indicating the presence of an
obstacle at each grid point.  It can be implemented as a 1-D integer
array with a simple indexing function to specify the proper array index
and bit.  If you have 32 kilobytes available, you can map a grid up to
about 500 x 500 points.

A list of obstacle coordinates is more useful where the search area is
very large and/or where the obstacles are fairly sparse and memory is at
a premium.  One way to store and retrieve the obstacle coordinates is in
a hash table.  You could cram both the x and y coordinates into a single
integer.  The list is a little harder to use algorithmically than a
bitmap.

I haven't actually tried these yet, so if you beat me to it, let me know
how it works out.  Good luck!

For a class project, I found a few alternatives for obstacle avoidance 
with known areas using evolvable code. You could call it mapping, I 
suppose, though it maps for a specific type of problems - those that have 
a "goal" of some sort (I used a lightbulb and analog photoelectric 
sensors for the light detection).  I'm in the process of translating i 
the best method (neural nets) over to IC (it's currently in C++). I do 
not remember how  big it was in C++ and as I'm using an older version of 
IC, I do not know how big it will be.

Basically what it does  is use a digital touch sensor to mark the 
obstacles (walls, etc.), and as it evolves, it learns to avoid these 
things. By using random "goal" and "start" positions in the evolution of 
the neural nets, it learns to avoid the obstacles and  when in use, it 
does not need a "goal" after the net is evolved. I don't know if this is 
what you were talking about or not. It's fun to play with, though. :)

On the 350MHz network I used to run the code for a known, simple course 
(four walls, two walls offor "obstacles"), it took maybe 2 minutes to run a 
few thousand neural nets through a few thousand evolutionary generations. 
Then, the net was thrown into IC code, and tested. Did extremely well in 
my rather biased opinion :)

The elapsed time calculation can result in negative numbers since the
system clock wraps back to zero when it's maxed out.  If the elapsed
time comes up negative, then the sonar_sample() and sonar_closeup()
functions return -1.

This could be due to the obstacle being very distant, accoustically
damped, or at such an angle that the echo bounces away from the
transducer.  My sonar will generally not "see" smooth walls at an acute
angle.

You might get more consistent results and maybe a little more range out
of your sonar if you change the code to compensate for the negative
elapsed times.  I think you could just add 32768 to the negative result.

You may still occasionally get sporadic readings for other reasons
(electrical noise, etc.).  To filter out the noisy readings, try using
the median of three consecutive readings.  It works almost perfectly for
my robot.  Besides, the way I defined the timing of the pings, my sonar
makes a "galloping" sound.  Good luck!

Hi all....I'm looking for a good source of 9V gear motors that i could

the little 9v motors that came with the board, which i have plugged into
the cheap gearbox from a toy tank, and it is starting to fall apart. 
ive found that building the drive system is the most frustrating part of
all my projects, and i was wondering what others have used and where

Try Lego Technic kits.  Start with a basic kit like the Giant Model Set
(#8277) for $44, and add a couple 9V mini gear motors (#5225) for $17.50
each and a gear assortment for $4.50.  Call Lego Shop-At-Home for a
catalog (1-800-453-4652).

If that's more than you're willing to spend, the Mondotronics Robot
Store (1-800-374-5764) has a Bulldozer kit for $40 that includes a
twin-motor gearbox.

The Bulldozer kit has a decent gearbox in it, however there are some
problems with it. The motors are 3v, so you really need to use an
alternate power supply. Also, the tracks are not very good at all and
will not last under any real use. the motors aren't very efficient
either and pull a lot of current for their small size. Overall i would
not recommend the bulldozer kit.

Subject: Extra output for clocking

I have a stepper motor controlled by a Motorola MC3479 driver, which basically allows me to input a clock and the direction from the handyboard and the driver does the sequencing.  So I'm using 2 pins from the HB's motor output for controlling the stepper motor.

The problem is the pulsing for the clock from the motor output is not fast enough and thus the motor turns too slow.  I've tried just doing a fd(0) and then bk(0), without a sleep(x) to obtain the maximum pulsing, but it seems there's a limit to how fast the HB can pulse the motor drivers.  

My question is can I use just one pin directly from the HC11 that can provide the clock signal to the MC3479 chip? I would assume I have to do a poke or bit_set?  I'm looking at the shchematics and I see that PB7 seems to be not connected.  Can I use that?  Or is there a simpler solution to all of this?

This is for micromouse project due in a month.  So any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks!

I would have to agree.  We evaluated incremental encoders from US Digital. 
We purchased the "low cost" encoders and paid just over $54 US.

Hi,

Does anyone know how to print messages to the IC's console window while
running
IC.exe.

Is it true that the handy board can only work when the LCD is plugged onto
the handy board ? It is because when ever it unplugged the LCD from the
handy board, the host computer losses synchronization with the handy board.

Thanks for helping...

Hugo Robertson:

     One of the nice things about the 68HC11 chip is its well rounded timming
system.  Grab your Handy board Technical reference manual and have a look at
page 48.  PA0-3 are "Input Capture" pins.  When the logic level changes
(according to the programmed level) this system time is captured and interrupt
flags set.  The program can then tell exactly when something happened.
PA3-PA6 are "Output Compare" pins.  Each of these pins can have a "time value"
assigned to them which causes them to change state.  In addition there is a
master time value which will change the state of all desired pins.  People use
these two registers to set the update frequency and duty cycle of this group
of pins to control servos (like the ones used in radio control airplains).
Using these timer pins you should be able to get clock signals into the
hundreds of kilohertz.
     It looks like TOC3 is not being used, also TOC2 is going to the IR
transmitter and might be available.   TOC5 goes to the piezo speaker, you
could use this if you either remove the speaker or put up with the noise.
     You may be able to control this system with peaks and pokes.  We will
need to hear from an Instant C guru to see learn how to handle the interrupt
flags.  Just peaking at the flag registers may be enough, unless their
interrupt signal actually interrupts the CPU in which case you would need an
interrupt service routine.  Any one care to comment on writing interrupt
service routines for IC?

hope this helps

there is no builtin way of doing this.  to get msgs back over the
serial line, see the FAQ question at:

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/faq/index.html#serial

you need a replacement pcode file to let the HB work without the LCD.
see

to find it.

These motors are exellent quality and very powerful the gears are metal and
the motors does not exed 300 mA @12V stalled.
I currently use the same motors on my robot and had no problems at all.  I
drive them using the motor drivers on the Handy Board and they don't even
get hot.

I highly recomend these motors!

To convert from 0-3 to 0-5 I would suspect that all you need is a 2N2222
NPN transistor with a couple of resistors to bias it.  For example:

                                     +5volts
                                   100 ohm resistor
                                     collector ----------0-5 input
  0-3v output -----1k resistor ----- base
                                     emitter
                                     0volts

Depending upon the 0-3v frequency, the resistances can be increased to
minimized the power used from the batteries.  Also the transistor is
just off of the top of my head as a general purpose NPN and if higher
switching speeds become necessary I'm sure there are more appropriate
choices for transistors.

hello,

i am having trouble conserving time in my IC code.  i am using an
analog() function, and a motor() function.  does anyone know how long it
takes to execute these functions?  also, do the encoder functions that
are posted on the website take much time in their execution?  i am
trying to fit my code within a 1 mS timeframe, right now, it takes about
26mS. is there any way that i can save time?  thanks for any help.

I'm replacing my aging home PC with an iMac (look at my email address: I can get one dirt cheap!) and I'm wondering if I can use it to pilot my trusty HandyBoard. Anybody have any experience in this area? I'd like to throw away the PC...

The iMac has no serial port, only USB connectivity but there is third party USB to Serial connectors available (http://www.keyspan.com/products/USB/adapter,  http://www.momentuminc.net/products/uConnect.html or http://www.griffintechnology.com/imac/iport.html). I just like to know if anybody ever tried one of those thing. Or if there is any plan to upgrade the handyBoad to USB ;^)

Hi

I did the port of the smoothpwm stuff into the IC 3.x source code. The
Newton Labs ftp site has the smoothpwm files available from:
ftp://newtonlabs.com/contrib/smooth-pwm/

If someone can get me the code for the FP fix, I'll see if I can get a new
pcode built - RL has been pretty heavy lately, so I've missed most of the
recent HandyBoard traffic....    :(

Thanks
Scott

I would have to agree.  We evaluated incremental encoders from US Digital. 
We purchased the "low cost" encoders and paid just over $54 US.

hi eric,

i haven't tried any of these products, but they *should* work.  the
mac hb software uses low level driver calls, so if that stuff is
patched and translated to usb, it would work.

but if i were you i'd get one and try it on an existing machine before
buying one.  please let us know the result.  thanks.

fred

It doesn't bother me that much: I haven't used a floppy in two or three years. I have ISDN at home: it's way faster than a floppy ;^).

Howdy Folks :)

I remember reading a web doc a while ago on how to convert servos so
their shafts can rotate more than 180 degrees... 

It was a nice doc, with pics, schematics, and everthing... but I lost
the URL... :(

Does any one know what doc am I talking about? Does anyone know this
doc's URL? Does anyone know any other docs on how to hack servos,
please?

I think it has something to do with a plastic pice that blocks the gears
from moving more than the what the manufacturer specified...

Thanks in advance,

Andre Philippi.

Yeah, I remember seeing that one; I may actaully have the info at home...

Anyway, an R/C servo has a hard stop to limit travel because the electronics
use a simple potentiometer on the output shaft for position feedback.  These
pots typically have ~300 deg. max travel, so the servo has a limit tab on
the output shaft (or it's gear) to protect this pot.  You CAN remove this
stop, but you also then have to remove the pot, and the electronics, and
wire the servo motor as a simple motor.  This is actually a nifty way to
make a small, torquey, gearmotor; but it isn't a servo anymore.

If you could find a multi-turn pot of the same value, that fits is the case,
you could make a multi-turn servo, but it might be easier to buy a "sail
winch servo" which does the same thing.

Hi,

I got my Handyboard up and going and was trying the following code for
driving my motors. (Figure I would try known code before forking out on my
own). The code I got from the 'Inspiration to implemntation' book. Anyways
it does not seem to drive the motors (no LEDs lighting), and I was
wondering if any one knows of any problems with the code. I've looked it
over and it seems pretty reasonable.

Thanks in advance,

The handy board is so user-friendly you dont have to go to all that
trouble. you control the motor ports using the HB library functions fd,
bk, off, alloff, and motor. fd(int m) and bk(int m) simply turn the
specified motor on (forward or reverse) at full power.  off(int m)
obviously turns motor port m off.  alloff() turns them all off (!) and
the motor(int m, int p) turns motor m on at power level p, where p is
between -100 (full reverse, and 100, full forward); however there are
only 8 real power steps.  because the HB library has already defined
functions to use those ports, your code probably interferes with them. 
i based my first hb robot on the code from the same book, simply taling
out all those functions that the HB already includes in the library.

hope that makes things simpler.

Hello,
            I am writing PID code that runs on the system interrupt.  I =
am finding that I have to rewrite alot of the great math functionality =
available through IC.  Does anyone know of a way to use an IC function =
on a regular system interrupt schedule?

Thanks,
            Aaron

Hi to all, I would like to know
 what difference there are if I connect the
6 diodes between the Handy Board & the Polaroid Sonar Card. Can I connect
the cards without diodes?
I tested the voltage at the Catode at the end of the 6th diode and my
Voltmeter showed 4.5 volts.

Should we use the 3 amp diodes?
Could somebody advise?...

Thanks in advance for your information. :-)

I haven't used the transducer multiplexor myself; I decided to just hook
up a second sonar module to the HB in the same manner as the first is
hooked up.  It looks like using the multiplexor ought to be fairly
simple, though.

First off, in the drawing you have the 9 pins on the sonar module board
backwards.  Pin 1 is at the edge of the board and pin 9 is toward the
middle of the board.

It looks like the multiplexor uses pins PD2 and PD3 of the SPI port,
each to switch on one of the tranducers (although it seems like a
circuit could be designed to use just *one* digital output to toggle
between the two!)

To enable PD2 through PD5 as digital outputs, do a bit_set( 0x1009, 0x3C
) toward the top of your program.  Note that this is a little different
from the bit_set( 0x1009, 0x30 ) that's used in the original sonar.c,
since that only required PD4 & PD5.

The PD2 through PD5 pins are mapped to the middle four bits of byte
0x1008.  Here's how to activate them:

               SONAR
SPI PIN        FUNCTION        SEND HIGH (TURN ON)
----------     -----------     -----------------------
PD2 (MISO)     transducer1     bit_set( 0x1008, 0x04 )
PD3 (MOSI)     transducer2     bit_set( 0x1008, 0x08 )
PD4 (SCK)      binh            bit_set( 0x1008, 0x10 )
PD5 (SS)       init            bit_set( 0x1008, 0x20 )

To send a pin low (turn it off) simply do a bit_clear with the
appropriate arguments in place of the bit_set.

First, switch the first transducer on by sending PD2 (MISO) high.  Then
ping the sonar by sending PD5 high and wait for the echo as usual (see
the sonar.c code on the HB web site).

To switch to the other transducer, switch the first transducer off by
sending PD2 low and then immediately switch the other transducer on by
sending PD3 high.  Ping as before.  Make sure you don't initiate the
ping without first switching one of the two transducers on!

I hope my explanation isn't too confusing and that I didn't make any
mistakes.  Good luck!

I'don't even bother using diodes at all
I just use a 7805 voltage regulator that is well heat sinked and never had a

The Polaroid Sonar board requires a supply voltage less than 7 volts. 
The battery of the handy board is around 12, so you'll probably shorten
the life of your sonar board considerably if you connect it straight in
(i.e. burn it up :.)).  The diodes are just a cheap way to reduce the
supply voltage to a safe voltage.  Any 6 volt source will due so long as
you maintain a common ground with the handyboard battery supply.  The
4.5 volts you measured is a little strange though, with the 6 diodes
specified you should be reading about 6 volts.

The battery for the handy board is a 9.6V cell (8 * 1.2V cells in
series.)

A normal 1n400X diode will drop 0.7V each.  (6 * 0.7 = 4.2)

9.6 - 4.2 = 5.4V

Hi all,

The motor(x,y) function in the lib_hb.c file works as expected (the motor
speed does vary depending on value given and the correct motor goes on),
but when I actually have a motor in the header both LEDs go on! (and I get
corresponding rotation in both directions). The activity (Led lighting and
rotation)is primarily in the direction I want, but also the other
direction. Any suggestions for a work around? Also it is evident at lower
speeds (less than 50) only.

Subject: Re: Extra output for clocking   


Thanks for the advice on the ouput compare and portA.  What I realized was the CPU time is being shared by some many functions, like the LCD printing, IR, PWM, that I'm not getting a fast enough pulse from the motor ports.  I disabled a lot of these features, and the stepper motors turned faster, but still not fast enough.  I tried doing bit_set and bit_clr on the pins you told me, and it works, but I think the problem is that I'm still working inside the interpreter, which slows down the pulsing.  I'm not sure if I can use the PWM somehow to do the pulsing.  Do you or does anyone know if I can vary the freq. of the PWM so I can use that as a clocking signal?   For incorporating assembly code, does the interpreter bypass that code and thus allow me to perform those functions faster? I'm not too sure how IC handles assembly code.

Thanks again for your help.

Hi,

We are trying to transmit our voices to our remote robot to create the 
impression that the robot is talking.
In addition, we want to be able to hear what the robot hears.

Does anyone know any products that we can attach to our robot that will 
enable something like this?

Thanks for any input.  :)

Justin,
            Thanks for your reply.  I assume you had one process doing the
PID in a tight loop, and then had other concurrent processes doing other
tasks.  Was there ever a problem with the PID process not getting scheduled
within the 1Khz system interrupt timeframe?

I was thinking of setting up an external interrupt faster than 1Khz, and was
concerned that depeding on the IC process scheduler may limit any gains of a
faster interrupt.

Aaron

That's a hard one because you have to have sufficient gain from the
robot microphone to hear someone 2 to 8 foot from the microphone. 

Usually communication equipment limits their microphone gain on purpose
to exclude background noise.  You have to talk directly into the
microphone in most cases.  

When you find a solution, please post it on the handy board mail list
will you?

How about those teenie weenie FM radio microphones that they advertise
"you can hear a wisper from 14feet away".  Usually in "Electronics
Now" and other magazines.

Yes, we have not only considered that idea, we have acted upon it.  I
guess the more operative question would have been: Is there a more
efficient method of communication other than the wakie talkies?

Has anyone used Apple computer microphones with their robots. The mic seems to have a left and right channel. It has a circuit board inside the case. I don't what the circuit actually does. It would great if I could just connect it to the handyboard or miniboard as is. Does anyone have any ideas?

A couple of years ago I built a small FM transmitter that had a small microphone
on it. I could hear whispers in the room next door when I turned it on and tuned
in a small transister radio to its frequency. This may be an option.

That will only allow one half of the conversation.  I suppose you could run
with two kits, one receive, one transmit, both tuned to different
frequencies.  

Another suggestion might be one of the cordless, battery operated intercom
system units.  Most of the units today that are wireless seem to require AC,
but I know in the past there were units that ran off a 9v battery.

I would only caution you that there are two types of microphones for the 
Mac -- regular mics and "PlainTalk" microphones.  I suspect you are 
talking about a PlainTalk mic.  The obvious distinguishing difference is 
the "longer than normal" male plug connector on the PlainTalk mic.  It's 
not left/right stereo but rather the long connector is for supplying 
power to the mic.  I can never remember all the various types of mics -- 
some are passive, some active -- electret, condenser, etc.  In any event, 
I believe the mic requires power and so is probably "active" and if 
memory serves me a condenser mic.  But someone else can clarify that.  I 
don't know the technical specs.

I would be interested in any schematics you would be willing to give up,
maybe even a little theory behind operation.  I must admit I am lacking
quite a bit in the communications area.

Hi, 

My Hb displays MEMMORY FAULT whenever I turn it on. SO I figured runneing
the hbdl.exe would help aleviate this situation. When I run it however, it
says it cannot open the port! Anyone know why? I have made certain that
the serail port is running as slow as possible.

Thanks for any help,
Shiva

The kit I used is DK-7 "FM transmitter bug" made by Marlin P. Jones &
Assoc., Inc
PO Box 12685 Lake Park, FL 33403-0685
(407)848-8236 FAX (407)844-8764

at least that is what is on the packaging label. It was $10 two years ago.
I got mine at a local electronic surplus store.

I have a handboard for sale, with display, only one L293D chip installed.
Has passed all the checks in the assembly manual, as I understand them.
$175.00

Also have a rug warrior board for sale, it is missing the L293D chip (it got
put in the handy board) and the sensors that attach to the board.  This
project is about 3 or 4 years old and I don't remmber the status of the
board,  I don't think I ever got around to downloading to the board.  $50.00

My email address is jburton@hsonline.net

Another possible neat solution would be to use a pair of VHF radio Data
modules at each end. These normally send digital data, but if you pulse width
modulate / demodulate at each end then audio could be sent.
 There is a company that advertises in Circuit Cellar Ink magazine , ABACOM
Technologies, Fax (416) 242 2697 - Voice # (416) 242 3120, No web site listed.
   In the latest Circuit Cellar Ink, they have TX & RX data modules for about
$25.

I am using a rug warior pro whose brain is very similar to the Handyboard
and would like to know if these VHF radio Data Modules could be set up
between the computer serial port and the Rug Warrior brain to provide a
radio link instead of the 4 wire telephone line.
                                Thank You

I would think so, assuming that you keep the data rate relatively low
(IMHO, 9600 bps would probably be pushing it, 2400 may be better)

Shiva,

When the Windows hddl.exe complains that it cannot open the port, it 
is usually due to another Windows programming using / holding that 
serial port.

Try all the comm ports to see if hbdl.exe allows it to open one of 
them, then attach the handyboard to that comm port.

If none of the comm ports are available to open, then check all the 
windows programs that load, and deactivate (or not load) those that 
us the comm port.
For example; Internet dialers, Fax software, etc.

Hi folks!

I've found Terri Cherr's idea of using VHF data modules excellent, not only
to exchange voice, but to communicate to a host computer also. The "robot"
could send sensoring information to a computer (or even another robot) and
receive commands. Now grab a webcam (or better, an infrared webcam) to the
robot and you'll have a very interesting toy.

Still waiting ansiously for my handy board here in Brazil, but I have other
plans than making a robot with it (I plan to use it as a small plc with data
acquisition).

As soon as I get it I plan to make some protocols for it, like Modbus and
TCP/IP.

See you,
Cesar

I use handy board and xc40 board(It has xc4010 FPGA chip)
The problem is that they must communicate each other.
But I don't know how I can make them communicate.
In Q&A(at mit's handy board home page) it says that SPI pin can be used 
as digital outputs.
If it could be used as digital output,Must I  make expansion board
to interpret SPI's signal?
Or are there other method?
If there is someone who experienced similar thing, please help me!

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
X-Mailer: AOL 3.0 16-bit for Windows sub 58

Hugo:
     I am not going to be able to answer this one fully.  We will need to hear
from others on the list to hear how to mix assembler code into an IC program,
how to have the IC program modify assembler variables, and how to set up
interrupt service routines.
     The following code fragments are from the Toshiba TMP68HC11 Reference
Manual 1990.  I have only added extra comments to make this more specific to
your application.  I hope this helps and I hope others can supply the missing
pieces.  If so, you may generate clock pulses over 100KHz.

The assembler presented in the manual is broken into two parts.  First there
is a "set up" procedure that initializes control registers and set the
interrupt vector.  This could probably be done in IC.  The Interrupt Service
Routine (ISR) should be written in assembler.  The hardware is expectin the
STD command to load new values into the output compare function and using a
different type of store could result in premature triggering of the output.
Numbers proceeded with a $ are hexidecimal, numbers preceeded with a numbers
preceeded with a % are binary, # are litterals (don't fetch from address).


Setup:
write the command "Jump To my ISR (SV50C2)" into the memory at the interrupt
vector 
for output compare 2

	LDA	#$7E		;Extended Jump Op Code
	STAA	P0VOC2	;(This is defined as $00DC on the Evaluation Board)
	LDX	#SV50C2	;Address of my interrupt service routine
	STX	PVOC2+1	;Finish JMP instruction to my timer routine

now set up control register so that the output pin will toggle state each time
the Output Compare Register matches the free running timer value and generates
an interrupt.  The value loaded will need to be changed for each OC register
used.  Use the logical Or of the following values to set up the desired OC
registers.  Some care must be observed in this part to preserve what the rest
of IC and the Handy Board is doing.  Someone please address the issue of how
the LCD control TOC4 is to be set up.

0100 0000	OC2
0001 0000	OC3
0000 0100	OC4
0000 0001	OC5

	LDX	#REGBAS	;Point to register block ($1000 on the Evaluation Board)
	LDAA	#%01000000	;OM2:OL2 = 0:1 (toggle state of TOC2 each interrupt)
	STAA	TCTL1,C	;Setup OC2 to toggle on compare
	LDAA	#%01000000	;For OC2 it is the same value but for others:

0100 0000	OC2
0010 0000	OC3
0001 0000	OC4
0000 1000	OC5

	STAA	TFLG1,X	;Clear any pending OC2F flag 
	STAA	TMSK1,X	;Enable OC2 interrupts
	CLI			;Enable all unmasked hardare interrupts

TMSK1 = $22
TFLG1 = $23

That is all we need to do for setup.  The interrupt service routine contains
the number that controlls the speed of the output signal.  In this examble it
is called HDLY.  This is the variable that should be consistant with your IC
program.  You should write a program that varies this number to ramp up and
down the speed of your stepper.  If it is easy you just include the variable
in your ramping code.  If it is hard, you write a subroutine that modifies
this value.  Remember that as the number gets larger the clock signal gets
slow.  Also remember that changes in small timer values make great changes in
frequency.  (This problem has given me trouble many times in the past.)  If
your decrease your timer dealy by two when the timer value is $07FF to $07FD,
your frequency changes less than one percent.  If you change the delay value
from 4 to 2 the frequency doubles.  
     I should also mention that the Interrupt service routine seems to assume
that the X register is pointing the the register block.  Above we seemed to
need to set this explicitly.  This is another item the IC experts will need to
comment on.  Now here is the interrupt service routine:

SV5OC2:
	LDD	HDLY		;Get Delay time for 1/2 cycle (Your variable here)
	ADD	TOC2,X		;Add to the last compare register value
	STD	TOC2,X		;Update OC2 [Schedule next edge] (The value MUST be stored with
this instruction)
	BCLR	TFLG1,X $BF	;clear OC2F
	RTI			;thats it, the pin will chage again after this delay

other values for the bit clear function:
$BF	OC2
$DF	OC3
$EF	OC4
$F7	OC5


TOC1 = $16
TOC2 = $18
TOC3 = $1A
TOC4 = $1C
TOC5 = $1E

     Well for what it's worth.  That is how you use the hardware timer
function.  They require software service to make them more versatile.  If you
get this implimented, your motors should really hum.  If not,... well have you
considered DC?

Hope this helps,
Pherd

Hi everybody
I seek someone who can help me.
I use handy board and xc40 board(it mounts xc4010 FPGA chip).
And I have to make two board communicate each other.
But there is  a problem that I don't know the method.
In handy board's F&Q page, It says that SPI ports can be used as
digital outputs.
Does it mean that just put a wire into SPI port?           
To use SPi as digital outputs which method must I use?
If there is someone who experienced similar case,pleas help me!
Let me kmow the method.

F.Y.I.

B.G. Micro no longer is selling the Text to speech IC "CTS256A-AL2"
they only have the SPO256 IC in stock.

This was confirmed by B.G. Micro on 12/07/98.

According to a few people they still sold them as pairs as of 08/98

If anybody else is looking to get the SPO256 spech IC I suggest to get them
while you can!

P.S. If anybody has any extra CTS256A-AL2 text to speech IC's I'm
interested!

Thanks

Hi,

I'm using start_process() to run a set of processes. My questions() are:

1. does start_process() re-initailize all the called process's (local)
variables every time it calls the process?

2. If the process does not complete before its alloted time, does it
continue from where it ended (from the previous call), or start at the
beginning again?

I ask these questions because I have code that runs normally for the first
few seconds, then suddenly goes through the processes much faster.

Thanks,
Shiva Sinha

Yes.  The subroutine acts just like any other function that you call.

Once you do a start_process, that subroutine will run indepently and
concurrently with your main program.  It does not "run out of time"...  it will
continue to run until it completes.  You do not want to call start_process again
(unless you know the subroutine has finished and you want it to run again)
because then you would have two independent copies of the subroutine both
running.

No doubt this is because you are starting multiple copies of the process as I
mentioned above.

Good luck,

I'm running IC 3.2 and am curious why this fails :

  #define HOURS     10.0              /* hours of logging */
  #define INTERVAL  5.0               /* minutes between samples */
  #define SAMPLES   ( (60/INTERVAL)*HOURS + 1 )

  float battery_voltage[ SAMPLES ];




the message on download is :

  charge.c(6): parse error close to token "("

  (line 6 is the line with float array declaration)



Does IC not handle preprocessor directives?

Thanks

Let's say I want to use a serial interface board without the "charger", as the
one provided with the Handyboard kit. The Tx and Rx lines are obviously
required, but what about the ground and power lines?...
Speaking of "easy to interface" data link solutions, I have a kit from Lynx
Technologies which is supposed to provide a wireless two way voice/ data link.
All that you need to provide is the tx/rx data. The kit has 2 tx, 2 rx modules
and RS232 interfaces on 2 development boards (for 2 way communication) it also
includes 2 antennas. I had to order another pair in order to provide the 2 way
data link.
Unfortunately, I have not had any luck. This brings me back to the first
point- is it possible to use the serial interface board by just providing the
tx and rx lines? 
I took a spare modular phone cable and tested it with the Handyboard's serial
interface board to make sure it worked... It did. Next, I cut it in half and
exposed the 4 wires. Judging from the schematic in the Handyboard manual, the
yellow wire is the rx line, the green is ground, the red power, and black is
the tx line. So I reconnected the tx and rx lines, and tried to run ic. When I
did, I got the message "Board disconnected or not responding". I then
reconnected the ground wire, but got the same message. It was only when I
reattached the red power wire that ic finally loaded successfully.
I guess my question is- with any of the wireless link solutions suggested, how
can we provide just the tx and rx data, without using the ground and power
lines? Or, at the very least, without the power line? ( Ground can be provided
from the receiver board).
Thanks again,
Dave

Last night we discovered that we had left our Handyboard on ZAP when we thought 
we had left it to trickle.  It was left at this condition for about 6 hours.  
This morning the motors are running very sluggish.  Are our Handyboard or its 
batteries salvagable?
Any comment on how we should proceed will help.

Also the Handyboard was not fully discharged when we left it.

Thank you
Chris Lott and Jason Moore

To properly comunicate with any PC you need to convert your TTL TX and TTL
RX signals coming from the Handy Board to RS232 voltage levels. The charging
board contains this interface IC called the "MAX232"

The power wire is required unless you are willing to power the Serial
interface board from a separate wall adapter and you definetly require the
ground wire because this is the common ground return for both the TX and RX
lines.

You need power to supply the MAX232 IC!

As for your second question I assume that most of these RF links require
only TTL level TX and RX signal and a common ground to work so there is no
need to use the charging board at all.

I hope this helps.

<<snip>>

Unfortunately, I have not had any luck. This brings me back to the first
point- is it possible to use the serial interface board by just providing
the
tx and rx lines?

<<snip>>

In short, no.  The serial interface board takes power from the HB to drive
it's end of the serial link to the computer.  If you want to convert the
link between the interface board and the HB to wireless, you should be able
to power the interface board with a 9V battery which you could stuff into
the (conveniently large) plastic base.  However you do it, the serial board
needs power, and if the Tx/Rx connection to the HB is wired, you need a
ground (common) wire too, even if the serial board is independently powered.

Has anyone had problames with the Handyboard, IC 3.2 and 'persistent'
variables?


the following declaration works fine :

	persistent float i;

but using an array:

	persistent float battery_voltage[ 320 ];

always causes an error while downloading :

	IC> load charge.c
	Reloading charge.c.
	Initializing interrupts
	Downloading 1552 bytes (addresses 8000-860F): 1552 loaded
	Downloading 76 bytes (addresses 8610-865B): 76 loaded
	Downloading 1627 bytes (addresses 865C-8CB6): 1627 loaded
	Board synchronization error: sent 119, received 12
	Unloading charge.c.
	#done

Otherwise, I very rarely see any "Board synchronization" problems 
with downloading, and the above is very repeatable, leading me to
believe IC doesn't like the persistent float array.

Thanks.

You probably should remove the battery pack, put it in a baggie, and take it
to Radio Shack. Buy a replacement from their selection of packs for toy R/C
vehicles.  Insist that they keep your old pack.  They won't give you
anything for it, but they are supposed to provide free proper disposal of
toasted NiCads.  If there is any gunk on the bottom of the HB or inside the
case, wipe it off with a disposable rag and finish the cleanup with another
rag dampened with baking soda and water.  Wash your hands.

Hi,

Now that the topic of RF commucation seems to arise again, I have a question
too. After looking at the RF modules of radiometrix and linx I concluded
that:
1. They are too expensive
2. They are probably not available here in the netherlands

Since I'm a student in electrical enginering I figured that I should be able
to build some RF module myself. But until now I did not find any hint/links
on the internet how to do something like that. Is there nobody out there who
designed a cheap working RF module for data communication up to about 10
kbps??

I just want a cheap RF link between my PC and HB.....

Hope somebody has any hints/links...

Thanx in advance,

Bastiaan Jansen

I try to buy the flash ram type NM29A040 or  TC58A040.
Or another type of serial ram eeprom for my HB.
But i don't know where i can find,buy it.
Does anyone know who sell on-line, this IC's.

Thank Fede.

From: Andre Philippi <philippi@earthlink.net>

Hi,

I have few newbie questions, and a contribution to make...

Background info: 
----------------
I have been playing with my HB for a week now,
using the free IC 2.850 under NTServer4.0... So far, Ive been 
sucessfully able to control DC motors, send beep()s, load and
run my own .c files... Was NOT able to make analog() or knob()
to work... 

Today I brought the HB to work and installed on my Solaris 2.4 box,
where I'm running free IC 2.850 for sparc/solaris... So far I've been 
able to acomplish the SAME as I did on NT...

Questions & Problems:
---------------------

1) According to the docs, I should run "dl pcode_hb.s19"...

This is what I got under NT & Solaris:

Cannot find file pcode_hb.s19 or file /home/philippi/packages/ic-sparc-solaris-
2853/lib/pcode_hb.s19

See "dl" output bellow...

Why is this happening? My lib path is properly set...


2) Because of the above, I've been doing "dl pcoder22.s19", which works fine...

Is it "Ok" to do "dl pcoder22.s19" instead "dl pcode_hb.s19" ?

What is the difference?


3) Knob() is not available...

	C> knob();
	Error in user interaction around line 1:
	        Function knob undefined

	...frob_knob() is available instead, but always returns 255...

	See "list functions" output bellow...
	
How can I make knob() work please?


4) analog() returns 255 all the time...

I have a photocell sensor (built according to docs) on analog port 1,
and no matter what I do with the light over the sensor, I always get 255...

Why? How can I fix that please?


5) After I load a function named main() and reset the HB, 
the board auto starts main()... So far, so good...:)

The problem is that according to the docs, I should be able to override main()
during startup, by pressing the "start" button while turning on the HB...

But that's not happening... main() is outo execing no matter what...

So far my solution has been putting the HB on bootstrap mode,
and doing a "dl" all over again...

Why is this happening ? How can I fix that, please?


6) The other day O posted a question on how to hack a servo so it turns 
infinitely,
instead of 180 degrees only...

Then I was thinking...

If I do that, then I wouldn't be able to know how many turns my shaft 
has done, right? 

I would have to use a shaft encoder, right?

Could I use a stepper motor instead?

Would a stepper motor let me perform infinite turns, and at the same time
give me some feedback on how many turns have been done?

Does the HB provide any kind of stepper motor support ?


7) Is anyone archiving this mailing list ?

If not, then I'm volunteering to start archiving it, convert it to HTML,
and make it available throuw a web server... 

...Basically, a web intercafe to the archive...

I've read that Fred prefers the mainling list format, but instead of 
replacing the mainling list (with a newsgroup, as suggested before);
I'd like to create a web interface to the mailing list archive only...

Let me know what you think...


8) I'm half way through building an expectk daemon, that listens to 
TCP/IP requests on port 2020 (temporarely), and forwards them to IC...

This way I (we) could use the daemon to build web, email, 
and even 2 way pager interfaces to the HB...

Anyone heard anybody making such developments?

Any ideas? Comments? 

Now it's the time for it... :)

9) That's it :)

IC outputs listed below...

Thank you very much in advance for any help...

Best regards,

Andre Philippi.

Hi Fred

I have question for you. I have to control a position using the 
miniborad or the handyboard. And I don't know which motors is good the 
DC servo motor or the stepper motor and whats the diffrence?
Another question if you don't mind, have you done or someone you know 
position control using either the miniboard or the handyboard and is it 
accurate?

Thanx verymuch in advance

	That's a funny question.  I just finished a class on this exact topic.  =
The
basic determining factors when deciding whether to use a stepper motor or=
 a
DC brush/less servo motor is speed and open/closed loop control.  Stepper
motors are limited to about 3000 RPM.  You should also determine whether =
to
use open or closed-loop control.  Closed loop control should be used when
the accuracy required is submicron (or ~0.00004 in), or when the cost of
position loss is higher than the cost of implementing a closed loop syste=
m.
DC servo motors should be used when there is a need for closed-loop contr=
ol.
If you decide to use a  closed-loop DC servo system, there are many
vendor-supplied cards that are a much preferred route rather that trying =
to
design a closed loop system.  Hope this helps!

hello,

i use the handyboard for closed loop position control.  the handyboard is
good for such a task provided that you choose a motor well suited for the
task, and an accurate feedback element, such as a (very) linear pot or
optical encoder.  as for choice of open loop or closed loop control, i
would almost always choose closed loop, unless you are not going to drive
any kind of load with your output.  if you were to have a changing load on
the output of an open loop system, then you will have an unpredictable
(somewhat large) error.  in my case, i use a DC motor, not a stepper
motor.  you ask about a servo motor; if you were to use a servo motor, then
you would not need a closed loop control system, that is already done for
you.  the handyboard comes with functions for servos, so you would not need
much design to take that route.  in the case of the store bought servo, the
accuracy is determined by the quality of the design, if you are planning to
design your own servo, then the accuracy depends on the components that you
use, and your control algorithms.  hope this helps, good luck.

 I had a similar problem using the freeware IC and I found that things like
the position in the code at which the persistent array was initialised made
a difference. Eg put the initialisation of the array right at the beginning
of your code, this helped in my case but it also causes the array values to
remain in memory at the same location even when the code is recompiled thus
preserving thier values over multiple downloads.

    Has anyone had problames with the Handyboard, IC 3.2 and 'persistent'
variables?



    the following declaration works fine :

            persistent float i;

    but using an array:

            persistent float battery_voltage[ 320 ];

    always causes an error while downloading :

            IC> load charge.c
            Reloading charge.c.
            Initializing interrupts

            Board synchronization error: sent 119, received 12
            Unloading charge.c.
            #done

    Otherwise, I very rarely see any "Board synchronization" problems
    with downloading, and the above is very repeatable, leading me to
    believe IC doesn't like the persistent float array.

    Thanks.

Hello this is mike, I am writing regarding the handy board.  What happened
was while working on the handy board, our motor control (the H-bridge)
heat
sink touch the metal chassis of our robot.  This lead to one of the
components on our H-bridge to start smoking, my lab partner disconnect all
external power to the handy board, and the H-bridge.  The communication
cable from the computer to the handy board was also disconnected.  The
handy board was then turned off, and later it was turned on.  When the
handy board is turned on the LCD display will not turn on.  The green and
red LED stay on.  We checked the batteries of the handy board and it was
at 10 Volts.  We started to trouble shoot the handy board last night and
we are not the best electronic technicians.  If any one has ever had this
problem please email me back, thank you.

I've heard the difference is that the buttons, the knob and the sensor
ports won't work as expected.  Try moving pcode_hb.s19 to the directory
that contains the dl executable, or to the present working directory, or
to the directory specified in the error message.  Dl will probably find
it in one of those three locations.  I imagine that will probably fix
most all of your problems.

There are some archives available through the HB web site.  I don't know
whether they're current.

I haven't heard of such things yet.  By all means, create a web
interface for the HB!  I'll then hook up a web cam and let others
manipulate my robot online.  Thanks and good luck!

hi,
The following command will cause the DC motor to rotote one after other
according to the std lib and the command. hence, the robot will gradually
slanted. It cannot travelled in a straight. 

motor (2, 100);
motor (3,100);

My question : how to  write in such a way to modify the library files so as
to cause both wheels of the motor to rotate simultaneously so that the
robot can travel in a straight line.

rgds,
phillip

 after reading your mails, it seems to me that the dc motor is better than
 the stepper motor. doesn't the stepper motor offer any advantages over 
 the dc motor? is the stepper motor that bad?

If the data tx/rx modules can't handle TTL levels is there any reason to
have the interface board at the PC end ?, why not replace the serial
cable going to the PC with the rx/tx modules ?. Surely this should work.

Bastiaan:
     I wanted to suggest that you investigate the Ham Radio community.  Some
search words to help get you started include PACKET and ARRL.  The first is
one of the digital communications protocalls used in Ham Radio, and the second
is an organization of Radio Amateurs in the U.S. (American Radio Relay
League).  You could also visit your local library to look for a book call "The
ARRL 19xx HANDBOOK" (where xx is the year of your choice).

hope this helps,

Actually, steppers do have some advantages.

1) If you do not have encoders on DC gearhead motors (or wheels, etc) they are
notoriously hard to position accurately.  Steppers can be
controlled very accurately.  Most servo motors cannot rotate beyond 180
degrees unless they are mechanically modified, usually disabling
their feedback pots so they have no position sensing.
2) It is hard to hold DC motors in a fixed position (if your robot is headed
uphill on a slope) while steppers can be "locked" in place by keeping
the coils energized.
3) Steppers can be cheaper.  Jameco has some small unipolar steppers for $6.
You can dig usable steppers out of old 5 1/4 inch floppy disk drives
for almost nothing.  Optically encoded DC motors are rarely very cheap unless
you find remainders, used ones, etc.
4) On the down side, software control of steppers is harder, they require
acceleration code (you cannot just "turn 'em on to 100%") and they tend to be
heavy.

I use both kinds of motors in robots for different tasks.

I have not been following the RF questions thread closely on the list,
so I don't know what has been mentioned.  I have had success using the
Radiometrix transceiver modules to establish two-way communication at
9600 baud between my HP 48 graphing calculator and the Handy Board.  The
HP wants an RS 232 signal and the RF modules want TTL.  So I have used
an rmax 232 to do the conversion.  Also, I have used a PIC micro
controller between the calculator and the RF module to change the modes
of the transceiver based upon control signals sent by the calculator.
The result is, I can drive my robot from my calculator (RF) and then
press a button on the calculator and return an analog value from the
Handy Board and display it on the HP calculator screen in real time. In
addition, I use the calculator to display data (distance vs. time)
collected form the Handy Board in graphical format.

Let me know if you want additional info.

Each motor may have slightly different characteristics even though they may
be the same brand and model. This is what you are probably seeing. The ultimate
solution is to use a feedback mechanism, like a shaft encoder, on the motors
and use software and/or hardware to maintain the correct speed. A cheaper alternative
is to experiment with different value pairs for the speed setting and manually
adjust them to make the robot track straight, then use the information to create
a change to your motor driver routines to compensate for the differences. This
complicates your software but is the esiest way to fix the problem. A pure software
fix will not be able to completely compensate for the differences in the motors,
too many variables to deal with, but is may be enough for your needs.

It depends.  if you are looking for higher top speed and more torque using
less power, DC may be the way to go.
If you want accuracy but don't want to deal with shaft encoders and the
code overhead needed to precisely control and monitor your DC motors, then
step motors are definitely the way to go.

I have used step motors as drive motors on all my robots, they are easy to
control and are very accurate and easy to use (I use a MC3479 step motor
controller IC, which allow a motor to be controlled with two data lines,
one to pulse and one for direction.)

outputs from the  SPI's pins (J6). i have poke to make the port as output
port. but the problem now is how to config the 4 bits. what is the location
and the mask bit to do a bit_set/clear. pls help as my deadline for my

The wireless data link from Linx Technologies has a built- in RS232 interface,
and a prototyping area to add your application. The board gives you the option
to route the tx and rx signals from this prototyping area or the RS232
interface by setting a few jumpers.
Since I kept getting "Board sync error" messages using the built- in RS232, I
decided to try to use the handyboard's interface, and route the tx and rx via
the prototyping area.
I'm still trying to get the thing to work.
The only problem I can see is that the transmitter and receiver on the board
uses 0 to 3V logic levels. I am using a 2N4401 transistor on the receiver's
output ( Base= 0 to 3V Data in, Emitter = Gnd, Collector = 5V to 4.7K Resistor
to 0- 5V Data out). Additionally, I have the data output of the transistor
going through an inverter, since the transistor reverses the logic. For the
transmitter, I have a 13K resistor in series with the tx line. ( This was
suggested for data rates below 9600 baud).
I am open to any suggestions.

   In response to rf link, How about standard wireless modems?
I know of a few which are made specifically for this purpose and baud rates
are between 300-9600 baud ,you set the rate according to your robots
capabilities.
If you are interested conact me via email.

Hi friends!

I need some help from you, it's being very difficult to obtain the parts to
make my Handy Board here in Brazil. I'm buying one from Hong Kong, but I'd
like to buy some extra 68hc11s and lcds, between other things.

I have relatives in the USA, but they couldn't find the part listing I sent
them, only in high quantities. I'd like to know from you some good suppliers
for 68hc11 and the other integrated circuits in general. If there is some in
Florida, that will be excellent. If someone could send me a list of
suppliers, I'd be very glad.

Another very interesting topic I've seen in this list is the rf link
modules. If someone have the rf link module schematic I offer myself to make
an interface pcb for using with the handy board.

Thank you very much!

See you,
Cesar

Jonathan,
	I would probably go with a futaba servo.  I dunno how much torque 
you need, but for a small(up to .30 cubic inch displacement, maybe even 
.60) engine, the s148 does the job quite nicely.  Tower hobbies sells 
them for $14, and they can be controlled by the standard servo routines 
that come in the miniboard library...

As someone mentioned earlier (and I can attest to the accuracy) 
www.bgmicro.com sells the 68HC11 for something like $6 to $8.  I bought 
two and they arrived in only a few days.

Nice people, good service (they sent me spec sheets once without me
ordering!)

HC11's for about $6.95 or so, and they have almost every part you'll need
for a HB, miniboard or Rug Warrior board. (MAX233 chips, 32k RAM,
crystals, latches, etc.) Several monts ago, I prices out
a basic Rug Warrior 'brain' there for about $35 (not including motor
drivers, PCB etc.)

Yeah, BGMicro is good, they seem to have a neverending supply of used
68HC11A1FN chips for $6.95.  If you want new, try:

Future/Active    voice 1-800-655-0006   fax 1-800-645-2953 (no internet
address)
41 Main St.
Bolton, MA 01740
USA

They list the chips at $16.30, plus a whole bunch of other interesting
stuff, and no minimum order.  However, I havn't ordered anything from them
since by the time they got their catalog to me we had already completed 2
HB's using chips from BGMicro!

First, to enable the four SPI pins D2 through D5 as digital outputs,
make sure you do a bit_set( 0x1009, 0x3C ).  (In the sonar.c program,
for example, bit_set( 0x1009, 0x30 ) seems to only enable two of the
pins--not all four).  I think poke would work OK here, too, even though
it actually clears bits in addition to setting bits.

The middle 4 bits of byte 0x1008 map to ports D2 through D5.  To send
the pins high, do the following:
                                          Bit mask
Port           Send high                  7654 3210
---------      -----------------------    ---- ----
D2 (MISO)      bit_set( 0x1008, 0x04 )    0000 0100

D5 (SS)        bit_set( 0x1008, 0x20 )    0010 0000

Of course, to send 'em low again, just do the corresponding bit_clear. 
You can set or clear multiple bits in one statement; you just need to
figure out what the bit mask equates to in hexadecimal.  You could even
set *and* clear bits simultaneously by using poke (instead of bit_set or
bit_clear) with the appropriate mask.  Good luck!

I get the message "Board disconnected or not responding" when I try to run ic.

have run into a slight problem:
With the serial interface disconnected, I hold down the stop button, turn the
handyboard on, and both green and red leds go off. This is a good sign that
the board has gone into download mode.
Now here's the catch: If I have the serial interface connected and repeat the
procedure, the green led stays on, and I get the message " Wrong port or board
mode"
I am using the same modem cable I have been using, so the cable is not the
problem. Also, When I turn off the handyboard both leds are off, indicating
that there is no problem with the memory circuit.
I replaced the max232 chip on the serial interface, and get the same results.
Could my serial interface be shot?
Thanks for your help.

Subject: config download problems
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi
I am building a handyboard from scratch after finding it on the net.
I actually purchased two pcb's from Douglas Electronics. An aside, they
were great to deal with answering all my questions promptly and
efficiently.

I built the first hb and had download problems, so I decided to build
the second hb pcb.

I have built the second board up to  section 4.4 serial line and stop
switch section. I am using a hb pcb v1.2 and an mc68hc11e1cfn3
microcontroller.

I have connected up the hb serial interface board to the hb and put the
hb into download mode ie hold the stop button down and turn the hb board
on. I thought I would burn the config register first before downloading
the pcode_hb.s19 file.

To avoid windows95 problems etc I have booted up my pentium with a
floppy that has msdos 5 loaded on it. No fancy autoexec's or config
files etc, just bog standard command.com.

I have issued the following instructions and got the following output:

I have done this twice as instructed on page 9 of the "assembling the
handy board" jan 2 1997 edition.

Has anyone got any suggestions.

I notice that  downloading of the config0c.s19 file, I had text
displayed in my netscape browser (under win95). I saved this text as the
config0c.s19 file. Is this normal or could some funny bytes been
included in my config0c.s19 file.

Thanks in advance.

Cesar,
  Nuts & Volts magazine caries lots of adds for just the sort of thing you
need (www.nutsvolts.com).  I wanted to mention here the 2 X 16 and 2 X 20 LCD
displays which are on sale for $8.00 each at
www.flat-panel.com.

Hope this helps

I'd like to thank everybody who sent me all this valuable information about
suppliers and rf link. I think now I can make my handyboard with less then
US$ 60.00 without the batteries and motor drivers (I want to use it in data
acquisition). As I have to pay a lot of dutties it will get around US$
120.00.


Thank you a lot for it!

See you,
Cesar

I just wanted to voice a warning of sorts.  I ordered the 2 X 16 LCD from 
them and the pinout is slightly different.  Instead of a single line of 
14 pins:

  x x x x x x x x x x x x x x

They come with a dual inline 2x7 pin configuration:

  x x x x x x x 
  x x x x x x x 

I believe they're compatible otherwise.  But you will have to make a 
rather nasty cable to connect the LCD to the Handyboard.

Perhaps someone could make a board with tracings and pin headers (male) 
that would connect the two - a sort of sandwich of sorts.  The 2x7 pin 
out seems to be fairly common these days.  Perhaps even the new 
"expansion board" that Fred and company are working on could contain an 
alternate pinout for 2x7 LCDs.

Hi, I realize that this is actually not a miniboard list, but since the
miniboard is actually the handyboards little brother, I figured maybe this
would be of interest.

About a year ago I was asked to help a local high school integrate their
research project into a self-contained experiment to fly on the space
shuttle. Their project involved cockroach research, and they needed to
record roach activity for 2 minutes every 4 hours. This provided 10 days
of recorded video using a 120 minute hi-8 video camera. Since the camera
wasn't programmable for record, we needed a way to control it. I had a few
miniboards around, and they seemed like the perfect solution. 

Using Linux/GCC as a c compiler for code development, the camera power was
controlled using a relay wired to motor port 1. We used infrared remote
control on motor port 2 to actually control the camera, since it had a
infrared control system built in. Motor ports 3 & 4 were connected to
small light bulbs, and a photocell connected to the analog port monitored
illumination, The pwm values for port 3 & 4 were adjusted to maintain
constant illumination levels. A simple elegant solution for video system
control.

This experiment flew on STS95 in November (along with John Glenn), and was
returned to the High School earlier this week. Review of the video
indicates the miniboard control system worked flawlessly, and video of the 
roach activity in space was recorded as planned.

Thanks Fred for a good controller design! I'll bet that miniboard
has travelled farther and faster than any of the others built.

     Thanks for your reply. 

     To answer your question about position control, let me describe my 
application. I have an Handyboard, stepper motor, and a linear system 
(ball-screw), and I would like to control the position of the part 
mounted on the nut of the ball-screw (x). 
     
     Hence, I will be using only one stepper motor, and I will very 
appreciate it if you can tell me what type of stepper motor is more 
suitable (single pole or dual), and is there any programs already ready 
to control those motors. 

     I am also wondering about the position error of the stepper motor, 
is it repeatable or how good is its position accuracy.

hi,

I am thinking of using motors with encoders built in them on my rugwarrior
board, but the problem is that the motor returns 500 clicks per revolution.
and since the counter can only hold about 32,000 the variable fills up and
overflows very fast.
so I was wondering if there is any way , I could get every 5th or every
10th click. so this way the motor returns 100 clicks per revolution.

I would appreciate any help that I could get,

Amit

Hi!

Could someone please tell me what is the Handyboard a/d range (60 mV?) and
how about it's accuracy?

Is someone interested to use or has used the HandyBoard in instrumentation?
I plan to make a temperature indicator / pid / fuzzy controller with
communication to a host computer. Should it be possible to use the
Handyboard a/d for temperature reading? I think 8 bits of resolution isn't
enough. The gain amplifier should be no problem, and a cold junction
compensation circuit wouldn't be that difficult too. I've never made
linearization, but I think it won't be a huge problem for the 68hc11.

 Maybe an external 12-bit a/d could fit well for temperature reading. I've
seen one from Texas Instruments that has spi, could that be connected to the
handy board? Can I connect more than one spi external circuit? How do I
diferentiate them in code (addresses?). Sorry, I'm a beginner and I only
dream with the Handyboard.

I'm currently writing supervisory software for pc in Visual Basic 5, it's
not bad. You can make an ActiveX exe for communication, and that gives you a
good multithreading and a separate process. If someone makes supervisory
software we can talk.

Thank you a lot for the attention,
Cesar Mello

Hi folks!

Here is my current shop list, as soon as I have my Handyboard here I'll try
to make a complete shop list.

1) First option: buy the unassembled kit from Pattrick Hui's Robot Store in
Hong Kong. Order by mail huip@hkstar.com. The standard unassembled price is
US$ 170.00, I bought the kit with a registered Interactive C that costs US$
190.00. Very nice option for who has the money.  Mr. Hui is very cool. PS: I
think it comes without the batteries, take a look at the site.

2) Build it yourself: I'll place the components I'm importing from USA here.
I'm not including the motor drivers because I plan to use the handyboard for
data acquisition and maybe to replace a Siemens S7 315 PLC! This is a
Handyboard option for poor people as me, so I'm including only the
essentials. The capacitors and resistors aren't included too, because this I
can buy here in Brazil.

PS: I'm researching this from Brazil only through the Internet, so maybe you
can find something wrong. If someone wants me to send news please tell me.

Subject: Problems getting a L298H based motor controller to work...
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
X-Mailer: Mutt 0.93i

Hi,
 
On Friday I received a L298H based motor controller kit from JCM 
Electronics.  The assembly was fairly painless, however I can't seem to  
get it to work.  I get 5 volts out of the logic battery output, so the
regulator is working.  I double checked that all the diodes were properly 
connected and I buzzed out all the obvious connections and didn't find any
faults.  I also carefully checked for solder bridges and didn't find any.
When I connect +5v from the logic battery output to the left enable and
fwd signal and expected to see 7.2 volts across the left motor output.   
But I didn't see anything...
 
I only have minimal experience working with this type of stuff (I'm a
software weenie) and I don't have the slightest clue how to debug this.
Any ideas what might be wrong or how I might go about diagnosing the
problem?
 
I've haven't done much assembly like this (wire wrap is more my speed) but
I was fairly careful (anti-static mat, temperature controlled iron).  I
thought that the most sensitive part would be the regulator, but it seems
to be working just fine.  I thought the L298 was a fairly tough part, so
if I fried it, I'm going to be in big trouble when I start working with
PICs (next step).
 
Also, my voltage source is a freshly charged 7.2 volt RC car battery and
I'm using a HandyBoard for the control (as soon as I get this thing to
work).
 
           Many thanks,
           Clem

Does anyone know of a supplier for the 68HC11 in the UK?

Also any handyboard suppliers in UK.

Hi HB-Users!

I tried to compile/assemble the pcode for the hb to get  a running version
for another display than 16x2.
I downloaded the environment for pc's (containing gcc and as11 and pcode -
but not for hb). Than a 
draw the pcode.asm for hb. When i now assemble the precompiled file i get
some
Phasing Error's from as11 in several lines. The value tuncated and bra
messages seem to be normal.
When i now download the s19 file the hb only says to dark square lines to
me?

Has anybody a running compilation environment on a pc running dos? 
Does anybody know what i'm doing wrong?

Bye
Bernd

Howdy Folks,

I just finish writing the first version of ICD; 
a small Expect server, that listens for TCP/IP requests on port 2010, 
and forwards them to IC (Interactive C).

Use it to make web, email, and even 2 way paging 
interfaces to the Handy Board :)

You'll need TCL 7.6 or above, Expect, and IC.

Enjoy,

Andre Philippi.

Just a simple question-
Does the HB operate under  Half- or Full Duplex Communication?
If it depends on the program, what is the nature of IC (half/ full duplex)
Thanks, 
Dave

Hi,

I'm tring to assembly a Handy board and I get to section 6. "The beeper and
LCD circuit". 
In section 4 I've got the pcode_hb downloaded in the 68HC11A1 and the error
when DL.EXE comes in the second phase. (I use the DOS version from Randy
Sargent on a 486SX Intel machine)  Now I got stuck with the LCD. I don't get
interactive C V 2.81 9/29/93, I get 16 black characters on the first row.
Also the charge LED was flickering on and off or was shining very weak. 

I have checked all the addresslines, datalines, control lines for breaks,
tripled checked the orientation or more the HC132, HC373 and the SRAM. Tried
another , SRAM, 74HC132, the LCD, and checked 74HC373. 

That was all OK I have deassembled the board to section four so the SRAM is
not on it. Download the pcode_hb.s19 again. The strange thing now is that I
don't get the error again when DL.EXE comes in the second phase when it
tries to access the memory. Why???

Also the GREEN PWR led (or TX led) is in the first phse of DL flickering on
and off but in the second phase almost not. Does the first phase hang up up
the download protocol of DL.EXE? 


This is what DL print on the monitor screen:

C:\IT\IC\dl pcode_hb.s19
6811 s19 file downloader version 7.31 1994
	Copy right Randy Sargent 1994

)


Finally tried another processor and another SRAM. I don't see the flickering
now with the other SRAM so maybe the SRAM is defected but with the other
processsor and the SRAM I still don't see Interactive C on my LCD. The LCD's
I use is a 2 row*16 and a 1*16. The one row gives 8 black blocks on it's
row. It is possible that these are defect because this where not new but the
2*16 I got from my work of the shelff?

I'm wandering if it could be the 
a)	PCODE_HB.S19 or the downloader? Should I use DLM in stead off DL? 
b)	Can it be the contrast of the LCD?
c)    Can it be the MC34064HC Reset circuit? ( I have used this one because
the DS1233-10 is hard to get hear in the Netherlands) Therefore I have also
let out the BATT led (and connected the tow holes of the LED to each other
so that the reset output is pulled up to VCC with the resistor)

Other questions I have is:

1) Why is MODB connected to GND instead of VCC? In the Motorola spec
MC68HC11A8 the normal Handy Board is the special test operating mode. It
says in this section (when MODB=GND) that it is getting his interupt and
reset vectors out of external memory locations BFC0-BFFF instead of internal
memory FFC0-FFFF. I don't know what the PCODE_HB.S19 does but this seam
strange to me.  When you connect MODB to VCC it is in the expanded
Multplexed mode. and then the reset and interrupt vectors is got from
internal memory.

Getting back to my first problem, when I connect MODB to VCC ( by connecting
it to MODA) I see the R/W# toggle on my oscillescoop and see the green PWR
led go on and off ones a second. That assumes that the processor is
executing the PCODE_HB startup code and tries to tranmit data to the PC.
When I connect it to ground the level of the R/W# pin stays at 5 volt and I
see glitches from about one volt around the steady high level.

2) Is it possible to zip the archive files. I would be much easier to
download them and review them locally.

3) I'm a newbee with a mailing list, sorry and sorry for asking but when I'm
joining this list do I get hundreds of email every day or do you get ones a
week the latest emails or how those this works? I don't know if I should
join this list but the archives have already helped me lot.

I hope any one is formilliar with this thing and can help me out. Please
send email to: eleenman@lucent.com

Thanks in advance and greetings from the lowlands in the Netherlands.

eric, i don't have a definitive answer, but here are two things:

1.  You *NEED* the reset chip, whether it's a DS1233 or the MC34064HC,
I don't care, but you must have a device that asserts reset (pulls the
line low) when the system voltage falls below 4.5v.  Otherwsie, the
RAM will not hold its contents when you turn the board off.

So, plesae get the proper component, and remove your jumper from the
BATT LED.  Put an LED in there!


2.  The board is *designed to operate in special test mode*!!  So make
sure MODB is connected to Ground!


there is more information about the design of the 6.270 board (which
is the precursor to the Handy Board) in the Appendix B document at:

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/techdocs/

Please read it.

I've just started experimenting with mapping and these are my thoughts on
it.

Drop the robot anywhere in its environment.  
The robot has a sonar hooked to a servo so the sensor can be scanned
horizontally.
As the sensor sweeps from left to right, only the time intervals that are
different from the last by at least a certain margin are recorded, along
with the servo position.
Each of these are recorded as arbitrary, but sequential for now, vectors of
a fixed size in memory.

After a complete scan from left to right is made
The critical points are identified by:

Identify the characteristics of your sensor
	The sonar we are using has a detection cone of about 40 degrees, this
depends upon the texture, material, shape, and size of the obstacle.  A
flat metal surface directed straight back at the sensor broadens the cone
to about 60 degrees up close (1.5' to 5' for the Polaroid sensor).  And
narrows the cone to about 2 degrees at very far distances (about 22' for
the Polaroid) because nothing else is detected at those distances.  The
surface used was 12ga steel 1'x1' smooth plate. Other obstacles were kept
out of it's line of vision.  ~2msec / foot of distance according to the
oscope used.  A person on the other hand could only be detected out to
about 7'.

So once you have some data on the 'sonar field width' for the different
materials, sizes, and shapes the robot is expected to encounter, a
weighting table, heretofore 'feature lookup table' can be set up to help
distinguish critical points of data by the apparent width of the cone the
objects produce at a given distance.

As the same analog value is produced while scanning, assume it is from the
same point on that object, even though there are other objects that may be
the same distance away.  Take the distance and average the positions at
which they occurred and store the location of the vector and its weight
from the 'feature lookup table'.  If the difference in positions of
constant values exceeds any in the lookup table, then create two new
positions that are at the mean of the edges of the sonar field width for
that distance and the associated mean weight of obstacles at that distance
(this provides a guess as to where the edges of the obstacle are).

Do this for all echo return time values that have a matching value within a
certain experimentally determined tolerance, regardless of other data
values being between them.  For 

Next look for values of progressively increasing, or decreasing time
intervals.  These are walls, couches, etc.
	If there is a somewhat linear relationship you only need to keep the
begining and ending values with a flag that indicates the data between was
connected.  This is to save memory.
	If the data is non-linear then keep the vectors as they are to compare
with once the vehicle moves.

From the present position of the robot, calculate where all of the critical
vectors should be once the robot moves a known distance.

Move that distance.  Rescan the area and compare the results.

For critical points that agree, increase their data weighting by some
value.
For critical points that disagree, decrease their data weighting by some
value.
For new critical points, record them as above.
When a critical point weighting drops below a certain value, it is
overwritten by new data.

If critical points tend to decrease slowly while adjacent points tend to
increase slowly, then this indicates that the robot may be moving in an
other than straight line, or there is some other systematic error that
needs correction.

By moving toward obstacles and checking them out up close, say with
infrared contact sensors, the weighting of the obstacles can be increased
significantly.  And systematically roving from obstacle to obstacle will
eventually map the entire area.

The map ends up be a set of vectors that move as the robot moves (a moving
map display).  The more it moves, the more exact the map becomes.

This is still a paper program, but this is the direction I am going.

Watch the critical angle for the sonar too.  If the sonar doesn't hit
almost straight on, some of the energy will be reflected off at an
angle, and may provide false longer distances.  Smooth surfaces will
have a lower critical angle then coarse surfaces.

Good mapping will take a combination of sensors, and actual wandering
of the room to detect all obstacles and make an accurate map.  Decide
your grid size, and program the robot to get to each size area, and
mark the grid as open or filled.

Has anyone had this problem:

    I am running win 98 on P200 MMX, and com1 is used by a serial mouse.  I
just bought the board, serial expansion board, and cables from Gleason
Research.  Comm2 is usually used by my internal modem, but I removed it and
changed the bios settings to use the external port.  First, I can't get
Hbdl.exe to work under windows, I keep getting the error "Wrong Port or
Board Mode".  The board is connected to Port 2, and is set to download mode,
i.e. no lights on the board, power on.   The funny part is, the handy board
pwr light comes on but doesn't blink or anything.  Then I get the error list
above.

    Next I tried running dl using the windows .if files, (dl code_hob.s19),
where dl is configured to run on com2.  Again the board is set up in
bootstrap download mode, i.e. no lights, power on.   I run dl as above, and
I get this

Downloading 256 byte bootstrap (229 data)
................................................................
................................................................
................................................................
.....................................___________________________

Timeout on serial receive 256 chars left to receive
Perhaps the board was not connected properly or not in download mode

    When a press return to start downloading, the pwr light comes on but
does not blink.  The ser light on the serial expansion board flickers
leading me to believe that data is being sent.

Next I decided to boot to DOS and pull the mouse and just use COM1 as my
download link, but I get the same results.

 Does the Handy board send data back to the computer through the com port to
signify that it is ready to receive?  Is there some setting somewhere I
don't know about?  How do I test the Handy
board to see if it is transmitting?  How do I test the expansion serial
board?

Any help would really save me a headache., Thanks!

In reference to your question about the motor with encoders.  I know this isn't 
a software solution, but what if you used an external hardware (chip) counter 
that reset after 2^(number of bits) clicks.  Then send resets as your steps to 
the controller.

I built two more Handyboards and I've noticed something odd.  When I 
download a program with a main() function, and reset the board, main() 
does not get executed.  I thought it was supposed to.

I'm using IC v3.1 (for the Mac) and Handyboard version 1.2.  IC says 
pcode version 3.10 is on the board.  Am I missing something here or could 
I have a hardware problem?

Make sure that your com port 2 is actually wired to the motherboard I've =
heard a lot of stories with
com ports not working because they forgot to connect the ribbon cable. =20
Check that first.  Try booting ito dos and use the DL.exe instead of the =

I have a system similar to yours P200MMX and I could never get the HBDL =

If I vere you I would invest in the registered ver of IC for $35 can't =

I hope that helps

Hi people!

I'd like to know two things:

1) Can I use the 68hc11a8 instead of the 68hc11a1 in the Handyboard, without
recompiling Interactive C?

2) What's the minimum hardware to run Interactive C? I just want to blink a
led to see if the hb is alive, the rest is communication. Has someone ever
thought of making a 7-segment cheap display modification in Interactive C?

If I could run IC only with the mcu and ram chip that would be fantastic. By
the way, can I use other ram circuits with Interactive C?

Thank you a lot for the attention.

See you,
Cesar Mello - still dreaming with the hb (couldn't get one)

I've never hot HBDL to work, and I've tried it on a 386 (laptop), 486 and
Pentium. Don't know why: just won't work under win3.11 win95 or win98. The
DOS one I've used with quite a bit of success. Make sure you are
restarting the computer (ie, turning it physically of  and physically
back on) in MS-DOS. If you go to start-->shut down-->restart in MS-DOS
mode you'll still have resident Windows drivers (don't believe me? Try
typing in 'win'. It will boot up faster than when you load it under a cold
boot.  Also, don't load config.sys and autoexec.bat (IE, go straight to
DOS prompt) You'll need to type

path=c:\;c:\ic\libs

etc. but you should no longer have conflicts. Also, check to see the COM1
setting in the BIOS. Best bet is to have it on ? 278H ?

Thanks for the tip on reflection error.  I'll have to build in a function
to weight the position accordingly.  I'm trying to stay away from occupency
grids and use the native vectors to conserve memory while maintaining
accuracy.  I may have to resort to a if I can't find addiquate memory
compression routines.

Richard,

	Thanks for the help. I finally got the board to accept the pcode.
I acquired a PS/2 mouse to free up my COM1 port. I used the HBDL.exe program
that came with the board. After several unsuccessfully attempts to program
the board, for some reason it finally worked. I found that it really helped
to let the serial interface board cool off before trying to use it. It is
also still very inconsistent. Sometimes I can get IC to recognize the board,
most of the time not. Windows or DOS doesn't matter, (I tried creating a
basic boot disk as recommended by one of the other responses, but that does
not seem to help.)
So here's my question. Does your serial interface board run hot, i.e.
noticeably hot to the touch. On my serial interface board (version 1.1 as
printed on the board) the white ceramic block gets very hot along with the
power chip? in the middle. If I had a bad power chip, would it cause these
symptoms, especially inconsistent performance!!!
BTW, how much was the power chips from Newark? Thanks for the help!!!

I had a defective DS1233 power monitor chip which kept resetting the board
about the same time as your's aborts. Watch the LEDs on the HB and see if
both go on and you hear a beep when the D/L aborts. If that's the case,
replace the DS1233 (I think that I may have spares, having ordered 5 from
Newark Electronics).

Your MAX232 chip may be bad, but you should also check or proactively
replace the four 10uF caps (C10, 11, 12, 13) which the '232 uses to generate
the 10V needed for serial comm.  If one of these is flakey it could
interfere with serial comm and possibly fry the '232.

Hi FThompson, Fred and other,
I encountered some problem in the downloading. I was successfully able to
 download the p_code into the HD. However, When the instruction proned me
to reset the board,it always appears on the LCD without any lettering like
"version 3.1...."on it . It is just blank with '16 dark squares' printing
on the LCD.

Besides, the computer showed synchronised with board, retrying ......After
several try, occassionally the lettering of the version 3.1 appear on  LCD
after reset the board. However, the computer showed synchronised with
board...., retrying .....
The situation is that it cannot initiatize the interrupt for standard lib
to down load into the   HB. Please help. Is it batteries problem ?is it any
chips damaged? We are using NIcad 9.6 v currently.

On a lark, I'll suggest that perhaps U6 is damaged.  If you have another 
74HC138 around, try swapping it for the one on your HB.  I had a 
"similar" problem (although not identical) and was able to diagnose the 
74HC138 as the problem.

I too was seeing occassional failures to come up and often saw instead 
the 16 black elements across the LCD display.

I also saw that when I removed the LCD while the board was running and 
re-inserted it, I often also go the 16 black elements.  I don't know if 
this helps shed any light.

I have now 3 Handy Boards and one was not working correctly.  I was able 
to narrow it down to U5 or U6 and with a simple chip swap with one of the 
good HB's found it to be the 74HC138.  BTW, everytime I pulled the chip, 
all the p_code had to be re-downloaded again - pulling the chip seems to 
do a complete brain drain.

If you have an extra 74HC138 lying around, it's certainly worth a try.

Hi friends!

First thank you a lot for the advices on the FingerBoard. It really gets
near to what I need, but that ram chip is another headake. So I believe more
in a "light" version of the Handyboard right now, later I'll make a specific
version and make it available for you. And now my Handyboard parts are
already bought, in some days they are being shipped! And with HandyBoard I
can count with this wonderful mailing list!

Sorry for being too beginner, but I'd like to know if I can load my own
Assembly programs (no Interactive C) with the same downloaders used with the
HandyBoard. And I'd like to know if there is a free C compiler for the
68HC11.

Another doubt is with the 68HC11 a/d range: I simply couldn't find it. Is it
possible to use 0/60 mV, 0/100mV or even 0/1V without external amplifiers?

Thank you a lot for the attention!

See you,
Cesar

Hi Fred and others,
I very desperate to debug the problem that took place in my HD.  When I
download the P_code, it is successfully downloaded. However, when the next
instruction ask to reset the board, no words of sentence appear on the LCD.
Only 16 dark squares appear on the LCD.  I have tried many times, it is
still in vain . 

Moreover, I have even tried to changed almost all the IC chips and it is
still no result. Except the 68HC11 and 74hc373 (U3) I did not change. I
have test out each signal is going fine. Besides, I have changed the DS1233
,it is still in vain .

I got this problem since last week. I have been working well with the HD
very well all the while. Suddenly, when the next morning I switch on the
board, such thing happen.

Please help me asap. I really very desperate and do not know what to do . I
have to submit the project 3 weeks times.

rgds,
chia

     According to my book, you can set the reference voltages to anything from
Vss to Vss + 6.0 V (notice that this is higher than Vdd).  The A/D result is a
ratioatic comparison for the sample voltage to the references.  Page 48 of the
technical manual shows that Vrh (analog Voltage Reference High pin 52) is
connected to +5 and that Vrl (analog Voltage Reference Low  pin 51) is
connected to ground.  To change the voltage reference range:
     First get a good pin placement map and be sure you know which side is up.
It is wasy to get top view and bottom view confused and wind up tearing up the
wrong pins.
     Second scratch the trace(s) leading to pin 52 (Vrh).  (If  there are two
traces, they will need to be reconnected with wire so that you are only
isolating the pin.)
     Third solder a wire to pin 52 and connect it to your 100 mV reference.
(Use your favorite noise reduction technique {coax, twisted pair,...}.)

     That should be all you need.  My book does not mention a minimum voltage
(except that the references should stay between Vss and Vss+6).  It says that
the A/D conversion is done with a "charge redistribution" system which should
be independent of the actual voltages used.  But the truth to that depends on
the quality of the capacitors and voltage comparator used.  Good luck!

Hope this helps

Hi Fred and others,
I very desperate to debug the problem that took place in my HD.  When I
download the P_code, it is successfully downloaded. However, when the next
instruction ask to reset the board, no words of sentence appear on the LCD.
Only 16 dark squares appear on the LCD.  I have tried many times, it is
still in vain .

Moreover, I have even tried to changed almost all the IC chips and it is
still no result. Except the 68HC11 and 74hc373 (U3) I did not change. I
have test out each signal is going fine. Besides, I have changed the DS1233
,it is still in vain .

I got this problem since last week. I have been working well with the HD
very well all the while. Suddenly, when the next morning I switch on the
board, such thing happen.

Please help me asap. I really very desperate and do not know what to do . I
have to submit the project 3 weeks times.

rgds,
chia

Hi Philip;

I am no expert, but after reading your posts I see possibly two problems.

1.  If the download does not go reliably, you may have problems with the
MAX232 chip on the interface/charger board, or with the 4 10uF capacitors
which connnect to it.  Additionally, you might want to check the cable and
connections to the computer, and also check the RJ11 cable and connections
from the interface/charger to the HB, they may have been damaged.

2.  If the download goes OK but the HB LCD shows black squares on reset, I
would suspect the memory power supply first, either U14 is not supplying 5V
at pin 1 with power off, and/or C4 or C5 may be shorted.  Look for solder
bridges and broken traces too.

Good luck!

What about the display board itself? Could it be that one of the SMT parts
on the board is dead? Or a trace on the LCD is shorted?

john calhoun,

     Mine just arrived and they are 1 X 16 connectors.  I ordered 2035TNLD/Y
displays for $8.00 each.  You might want to order now while they have the 2X16
displays with 1X16 connectors.

    I have soldered the connector on and tested it and its works fine.

Good Luck,
Pherd

 I just wanted to voice a warning of sorts.  I ordered the 2 X 16 LCD from 
 them and the pinout is slightly different.  Instead of a single line of 
 14 pins:
 
   x x x x x x x x x x x x x x
 
 They come with a dual inline 2x7 pin configuration:
 
   x x x x x x x 
   x x x x x x x 
 
 I believe they're compatible otherwise.  But you will have to make a 
 rather nasty cable to connect the LCD to the Handyboard.
 
 Perhaps someone could make a board with tracings and pin headers (male) 
 that would connect the two - a sort of sandwich of sorts.  The 2x7 pin 
 out seems to be fairly common these days.  Perhaps even the new 
 "expansion board" that Fred and company are working on could contain an 
 alternate pinout for 2x7 LCDs.

Subject: dc motor output control?????????????????

hi everyone,

i need some help on controling the output voltage of the dc motor ports. the
output voltage is 9.6V and i like to know if there is any way to clamp down
the voltage to 5V or lesser. i try using a enternal resistor but the output
signal is very unstable. sometimes when i am controlling only motor port 0,
the other motor port's LED will light up too. i have try using the PWM
signal, but the output voltage is still 9.6V. what has change is only the
'on' time of the output. 

please help!!!

Thanks

Hi friends!

Thank you for the replies about this topic. Now I could get a Reference
Manual too...

The a/d range is determined by the references given to the VrefH and VrefL
pins. But be careful about this:

"There should be at least 2.5V between VREFL and VREFH for full A/D
accuracy. Lower values will result in more inaccuracy, but the converter
will continue to operate. The A/D system is tested at 4.5 and 5.5V across
the reference supply pins."

See you,
Cesar

Hi
I have an IC program (c text format), and I want to download this 
program to the eeprom of the handyboard and run it without having 
connection with the host PC (remove the phone cable) and use the start 
button to run. How I can convert my c file to an s19 file so I can 
download it into the eeprom???
Thanx

Baraki

Hi!

>for the same?  Anyplace I can get more info on this? I have a bunch of old
>drives laying around.


okay, another newbie reply :-) After I received this message I opened
several 5 1/4 drives that were going to trash at my job and took all the
stepper motors and integrated circuits. Here's what I figured out:

1 - All the stepper motors I found have 5 wires, one of them is black. You
connect this black wire to a common source (could be gnd). The others go to
your driver. In the simplest case this can be 4 buffers. You have to put 12
vdc on ONE of these wires at a time, sequentially. The sequence order
determines the direction.

2 - If you want your motor to rotate only in one way, you can use one of
your hb outputs as a clock for a counter as 4017. Each pulse makes your
motor rotate 1.8 degrees, so you need 200 pulses for a revolution.

3 - If you want it to rotate in the two ways, you can use 2 outputs from
your hb and wire them to a diode matrix,so that you place a 2-bit binary
word and get 4 decimal distinct outputs. Then you increment the value of
this word to rotate in a way, and decrement it to rotate in the other way.

4 - The driver I found on some floppy drives was uln2003an. But keep all the
socketed integrated circuits. Anyway you can always use 4 transistors :-)
and I'd suggest that.

If you want some circuits I have some, so please ask me.

I generally use very common parts like diodes because I don't live in your
electronics paradise (USA).

Another way you can have some fun is connecting those diode matrixes to your
pc paralell port. You can easily connect 4 stepper motors and exercise your
algorithms.

Hope this could help!

See you,
Cesar

You don't need to put that code into eeprom=2E  Just put the code inside a
main() function block like this:
void main(void)
{
  YOUR CODE
}
Be sure and include the start button logic at the start of your code=2E  The
handyboard with start and automaticly execute the main function=2E  The
battery will keep the code in RAM when the board is switched "off"=2E

Hi
I have an IC program (c text format), and I want to download this
program to the eeprom of the handyboard and run it without having
connection with the host PC (remove the phone cable) and use the start
button to run=2E How I can convert my c file to an s19 file so I can
download it into the eeprom???
Thanx

Baraki

I'm not sure my previous mail came through but I have gone high-speed by

change my Handyboard mailing list subscriber address from jaron@cybercomm.nl
to j.paludanus@cable.a2000.nl. I still appreciate your list very much
although I haven't had time to do something with my HB for a while now.

Hi,

I stopped working with the handyboard for a while but just started back up
again.  I put the expansion board onto my handyboard and began testing it.
After testing the general tests done before with just the handyboard I
started testing the servo ports.

I am having some trouble with controlling the ports though.  When I enter
init_expbd_servos(int action); from the computer via IC, the motor turns
completely clockwise.  It does not matter what my integer is as long as it
is not zero.  I am not sure what the action variable should be in any case.
I also am unable to change the direction of the servo no matter what action
value is given or what value I give servo0, the port that the motor is
plugged into.

Can anyone give me any suggestions as to how to control the servo?

Thanks,

AhHa!

The expansion board lives!  I hope that now we all have winter break we'll
start to hear from the other beta testers again.
I know I've been slacking due to other commitments and an unrelated comm
problem with my HB, but I'm anxious to get with it again as soon as I finish
my ^#&@( shopping.
Anyhoo, though I left it home (I'm at work, and didn't want the temptation)
I'll try to help from my somewhat rusty memory of my servo experiments:
1. The servo control function does not load by default, make sure you load
it.
2. Not all servo pinouts match the Futaba standard used on the board; I had
to swap leads on my Airtronics servos.

Hope this helps!

Try this link.
http://incolor.inetnebr.com/bill_r/polaroid%20sonar%20mod.htm.  It shows
modifications for interfacing the one step board to a microcontroller.
I also have an old one step ($1 at a garage sale) but I have not tried
the modifications shown for use with the handyboard.  I have taken the
camera apart and it seems to match the photos and diagrams shown at this
site but that was as far as I got.  I would be interested to hear how
you or anyone else may get it to work with the handyboard.  Good luck.

Maybe you can put a series of diodes in series and in parallel but the
other direction to reduce the voltage.

H-bridge     +-  +-  +-  +-    motor   H-bridge

Good luck,

On my first robot, I just took a resistor in-line and used that. It got
very hot, though, and didn't work evenly (some of them must have started
to burn out before the others did....)

How about lifting pint 8 of the L293 chip and running a wire from it to a 7805
regulator (not the one used for logic).  You could also run the wire to a
separate battery pack.  4 NiCds in series gets you real close to 5V with no
regulator.  In motor circuits, it is important to reduce loss.  See page 49 of
the technical Reference for a schematic of the motor outptu section.

Subject: new 6811 Downloader for PowerMac G3's!

Hi everyone,

I've built a new version of a 6811 Downloader application for Mac that
works fine with PowerMac G3's.  (It also works with older Macs.)

You can download it from the Handy Board home page:

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/

yours,
Fred

Hi everybody,
When the one end of the RJ11 cable plug into the RJ12 side entry(J10), it
supposed the red LED on the charger board will light up. However, it failed
to light up. Hence, this made the booststrap failed and I unable to
download the P_code.

When I plug in the adapter into the Power Jack J11 on the charger board,
the red LED light up but NOT  the yellow LED.  In this case, I able to
download the P_code successfully. 

When I plug in the adapter into the HD instead the charger board, I unable
to download the P_code. There is no yellow and red LED light up.

I did a measurement on the voltage drop on the voltage regulator (U17) on
the charger board. From Pin 1, the voltage drop is 1.2V only as it is
supposed to be 9.6v . The voltage measured from pin 3 is also 1.2 voltage
as is should be 5v. 

please advice.

rgds,
phillip

Subject: encoder and motor questions
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

dear viewers
here are some questions i need to ask:
1) my DC motor comes with a 10 pin optical encoder(supply current-10mA)
   pin 1- GND
   pin 2- Vcc
   pin 3- dir
   pin 4-standyby
   pin 5 and 6  - A1 and A2
   pin 7 &8     - B1 and B2
   pin 9 and 10 - Z1 and Z2
   how do i connect my encoder part to the handy board?
   can i ignore the encoder?
   my robot only needs to sense retroreflective white tape, can i just
use suitable sensors instead of using encoders?
   ( The pins I listed are just for details)

2) i am using a separate motor battery source of 30 V to connect to the
handy board cause my motors supply around 30V.what is roughly the
suitable and max. current needed for the 30V external battery source to
be able to supply to the handyboard to prevent the handyboard from
"frying"?

thank u for reading my problems
i would appreciate if anyone could respond to me directly to my email
address : soundstruck@pacific.net.sg 
u could also reply to me on the mailing list if its for convenient for u
hope to hear some news
thank u

hard to tell what is wrong.  do you have a scope so that you can view
the servo control signal.

hi,

can i have 2 sets of serial communications at the same time with the
handyboard?

i have 1 set that is between the handyboard and the SSC via pa7. i want to
have another channel, pc serial application to handyboard, in that one 
direction only, via the serial (RJ11) port.

thanks much!

I've had a similar problem, make sure your servo power is fully charged.  An
undercharged system will sometimes drive all the way one way.

I also saw a similar problem while experimenting with an Atmel microcontroller
and a Futuba servo. My problem ended up being that I had forgotten to have a
common ground between the controller and the servo. Once I connected the grounds
everything worked like a charm.

hI Anthony and others,
I just plug in the RJ11 in the HD and charger board. It supposed that the
red LED on the charger board should light up. It failed to light up. When I
plug in the adaptor onto the charger board, the red LED light up but NOT
the yellow LED. However, it still cannot download the P_code.
Hence, I still encounter the booststrap download failed. I have changed the
rectifier and voltage regulator . There is no result of it. I have tried to
use the RJ11 on a good charger  board which from my friend. It has no
problem. Hence, this deduce that the RJ11 has no fault. I've also changed
the MAX232 chip. The booststrap still failed. 

You have mentioned thatthe capactors may be the fault. WHY ??? I did not
try that to change. 

Besides the changing the capacitor, it there any other possibility that the
booststrap failed ? Please advice.

thank you .


Rgds,

Hello again,

I am using a Tower Hobbies System 3000 servo motor on my expansion
board.  Does anyone know if the black, red, and white wire match up with
ground, 5 volts, and control respectively for that particular brand of
servo motor?

Subject: dc motor output control? Please help!

hi everyone,

i need some help on controling the output voltage of the dc motor ports. the
o/p of the motor port is 12V. but my motor required voltage is only 3V.

i like to know if there is any way to clamp down
the voltage to 5V or lesser. 

i try using a enternal resistor of 8 ohms 5 watts to reduced the voltage
across the motor and also write a sample program to on the motor for 1 sec.
but the motor is always stalled. the HB will be in the reset mode causing
the motor port to be on continuously. however after toggling the on/off
switch for about 5 times, there are 2 kinds of situation forming up.

situation 1:
the o/p of the port is very unstable. it on/off for 1 to 2 time then allow
HB to end the sample program i write.

situation 2:
motor port 0: green led on
motor port 1: red led on
motor port 2: red led on
motor port 3: red led on
the HB is in the reset mode again.

please help!!!

Thanks

Michael

the short answer is that you can't use 3v motors with the handy
board.  the FAQ states this:

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/faq/index.html#compatiblemotors

if you use the "separate motor power supply" hack, with a 6v battery,
you might be able to get 3v motors to work.  see

I assembled the HB board some 2.5 years ago.  At that time it seemed to work
very well.  The hook is that I'm quite strong on the Hardware side and rather
anemic with regard to software.
  In the earlier time I would download it from a Mac 11si-no problems.  I
shelved the HB but am now again very interested.  During that time of dormancy
I left the HB plugged in.

The problem now:  I am useing a Mac PPC-6500.  I cannot seem to download
Lib_hb.asm, lib_hb.lis, lib_hb.c or lib_hb_icb, or hb.test.c >  My
documentation says that these programs are required for the HB to run
correctly.

It will add numbers, print things in the LCD, play bicycle.c

IT WILL NOT load hb.test.c, as I mentioned & then go to testmotors();  making
the LED"S flash
 Useing INIT printer(part of the IC 2853-Rev 2.1)-that works some times but
usually times out.   Just
useing IC printer always works.  The 6811 Dowloader does not seem to ever work
while the other one-I dowloaded today does but when I used it for HBtest.C-it
dowm loaded but then then I went to IC2.853 and the console said it wasn't
there.  Or what will happen if I happen to get hbtest.c loaded(it doesn't list
it) but will say error at line 48 and line 52 etc etc.
  When you're hardware saavy but not software-it's almost impossible to know

Use 6811 Downloader to download pcode_hb.s19.  Power cycle, and the
Handy Board should beep and display a version message on its LCD
screen.

Then, run IC modem or IC printer depending on which port you are
using.  It should be configured to boot with lib_hb.lis.

hI FRed, anothony and others,
I just plug in the RJ11 in the HD and charger board. It supposed that the
red LED on the charger board should light up. It failed to light up. When I
plug in the adaptor onto the charger board, the red LED light up but NOT
the yellow LED. However, it still cannot download the P_code.
Hence, I still encounter the booststrap download failed. I have changed the
rectifier and voltage regulator . There is no result of it. I have tried to
use the RJ11 on a good charger  board which from my friend. It has no
problem. Hence, this deduce that the RJ11 has no fault. I've also changed
the MAX232 chip. The booststrap still failed. 

You have mentioned thatthe capactors may be the fault. WHY ??? I did not
try that to change. 

Besides the changing the capacitor, it there any other possibility that the
booststrap failed ? Please advice.

thank you .

phillip,

please go through the sequence of tests in the assembly directions (as
if you were building the serial/charger board from scratch), and
indicate the point at which you first detect a problem.

Since the System 3000 servos appear to be made by Futaba, and they specify a
standard Futaba "J" connector, my guess is that they would plug right in.
Futaba practice is as you state: red=5V, black=common, white=signal.

Hello again,

I am using a Tower Hobbies System 3000 servo motor on my expansion
board.  Does anyone know if the black, red, and white wire match up with
ground, 5 volts, and control respectively for that particular brand of
servo motor?

  This is a followup to your answer regarding downloading problems

     1.  The 6811 Downloader does not seem to work with HB.  I get mesaages
varying from recieved 0, wanted 255-or serial port not responding.  I am DL
from a MAC PPC 6500 OS 8.

	2.  This HB when built 2.5 years ago ALWAYS  worked useing DL's from a
Mac11si  OS7.1

	As I speak-the LCD of the HB shows Interactive C V2.81 9/28/93 along with the
beating heart-indicative, according to my understanding, that we are ready to
go.

	3.  If that is the case-however-I show no libs-hb.lis, hb.c, and hb.icb plus
hbtestc.   I HAVE been able-or I should say- HB DowloaderMC will DL these
files if I can trust the green blinking light on the HB serial interface.

	4. But-when I then use printer IC console-I show no reference to the software
referenced in #2.   It will not run any of ther hb.test.c functions.   It will
run other functions from the 2.53 IC library such as bicycle.c

	5.  I am positive it is not running completely but would have to admit I have
no explanation why it run some software and not others parts-for example
testmotors(),

	Would the purchase of IC-commercial help out-something I plan to do but am
loath to do until I am sure everything is kosher.  I am suspicious of the
downloading process because sometime  IC2.53  INIT Board works-sometimes it
doesn't.  The lites on the HB respond the way they should-hold stop-turn off-
turn back on with the red and green LEDs on for 1/3 of a sec-then off.  Thanks

please download the latest 6811 Downloader for Macintosh, just posted
last week on the HB web site.  Fixes compatibility probs.

OK, yes, you've already downloaed.

please download these files from the HB web site and put them in the
ic-libraries folder.  then use resedit to modify IC to have lib_hb.lis
as its default library file.

you have to manually load hbtest.c

testmotors() is defined in hbtest.c.  you must specifically get
hbtest.c from teh HB web site, put it in your ic-libraries fiolder,
and then tyope "load hbtest.c" from the IC cmd line.

try the new 6811 Downloader, this should fix any init board problems.

I haad similar problems and then I realized that I did not need to

dear readers and fred martin

my DC motor comes with a 10 pin optical encoder(supply current-10mA)
how do i connect my encoder part to the handy board?
can i ignore the encoder?
my robot only needs to sense retroreflective white tape, can i just
use suitable sensors instead of using encoders?   ( The pins I listed
are just for details)
hope to hear from u soon
thankx
   pin 1- GND
   pin 2- Vcc
   pin 3- dir
   pin 4-standyby
   pin 5 and 6  - A1 and A2
   pin 7 &8     - B1 and B2
   pin 9 and 10 - Z1 and Z2

we are developing a small rover here at V.E.S. Institute of technology,
India and we are using DC motors made by a manufacturer here in
Bombay,India. They make all kinds of DC motors and special internally geared
motors having the ratings that we require. These motors are available in the
range of RS. 960-1100 ($25 only) .
And are available at student discount rates of about 650-700 ($15). But then
shipment would be a problem for you :: In case you are still interested I
will try to get a mailing address of the dealers or would pass on their
phone numbers to you.

Regarding the DC motor manufacturers that I had sent you a mail about. Here
are the details:
I have talked to the manufacturer here in India for obtaining the details
for you and the good news are that they already export these motors to the
USA. Here is the contact address that I have obtained of their
distributor/dealer in the USA
omkarc@aol.com
The contact person out there is Mr. Rajan Shah
You can obtain more details directly from him and in your mail you can
include a reference that you obtained the contact from Mr.. Hemal Patel of
Lunar motors based in Bombay, India.
The motors that we are using for our project is the CR-500-GB1 heavy duty
geared motor having voltage specifications from 6-12 V D.C. and available
speeds are 4 to 90 RPM. These are pregeared motors which can be directly
connected to the wheels and the output shaft can have the speed that you
specify.
You can obtain the detailed catalogue from the above mentioned dealer.

Hello All-

Just as a data point for Randy......

I have installed 3.2 beta 1 pcode on my HandyBoard, and I get the right

It would be great if everyone put something in the header of every

from the list automatically filed.  Could we put something like 'HBLS'
in the subject of every message for the list?

Subject: sensors input

hi  everyone,

i have tried to configure a set of sensors used for sensoring the wall in
the maze.

the circuitry of each of the sensors is:
                         +5V        +5V
                        -----      -----

                          |          |
                       -------      |/
         IR emitter      \./        |\ IR receiver
                        -----        |
                          |          |

                         GND        GND

the IR sensor is sharing the same +5V source and the same ground. but when i
assembly 16 of them together, the habdyboard will immediately switch to
reset mode. so i tried to troubleshoot by only connecting the digital sensor
port and it works. but after about 2mins, the HB switch to reset mode again.
the same situation happen when i tried with the analog port only.

i like to know what is wrong and how to solve. could it be the wire is short
or the circuitry is faulty? or could it be the HB cannot supply enough
current to the sensors ? 
please help! i am really at my wits end.

michael

Can you possibly share your complete design (maybe in a web page ?).
That would be a graet service for us all. Thanks

Greetings everyone,

It's the last day of 1998, so it's a good time to announce the
official release of the Handy Board expansion board.  The Handy Board
Expansion Board is officially released!

The Expansion Board plugs on top of the Handy Board, and provides the
following features:

*	10 additional analog sensor inputs.

*	4 inputs for active LEGO sensors (reflectance sensor and shaft
encoder).

*	9 digital outputs.

*	6 servo motor control signals.  Power may be supplied from the Handy
Board's internal battery or an external source.

*	connector mount for Polaroid 6500 ultrasonic ranging system.

*	general-purpose electrical prototyping area.

*	pass-through connector for the Handy Board's LCD screen. 

A lot of people have contributed to design through their suggestions
and feedback.  I'm sorry it's taken so long, but, better late than
never.

Three vendors have already lined up to sell Expansion Board blank
PCBs, parts kits, and assembled boards.  Kits are in stock now;
assembled boards will be available mid-January.

All information is available at

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/hbexp30/

Thanks everyone for your encouragement in getting this design done.

Yours,
Fred

Dear friends,
	   With respect to page 31(page no as taken from printout) of the
Handy board assembly manual  (hba.pdf) downloaded from 
http://el.www.media.mit.edu site, it has been said there that custom
software shall be available soon for testing memory.I want to know whether
the software is available at present and from where it can be obtained.
						        Yours sincerely,

You don't really show your connection to your Handyboard, but I would
suspect that with 16 connectted in parallel, you are probably drawing
sufficient current to drop your voltage below the reset value of the
micro monitor (DS1233? if I remember corretly).
Perhaps try testing the voltage with all in place, and making sure it is
above about 4.5v.

michael,

   The parallel combination of resistors is the recprical of the sum of their
recpricol values.  
   Req = 1 / ( 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ...)

Your 16 LED resistors combine to make

 Req = 1/( 16 x (1/82)) = 5.125 ohms.  So your LEDs are drawing just under 1
Amp.  (Remember there is a small (about 0.5V) voltage drop across the LED
itself.

     The parallel combination of your 16 Sensor resistors is

 Req = 1/( 16 x (1/120,000)) = 7500 ohms, a little easier to support.  The
voltage drop across the sensors is expected to be much larger than 0.5 Volts.

     I would suggest that you take another look at the problem you are trying
to solve.  See if one LED can support several sensors, or if a single sensor
set will work with a much larger LED resistor.  Otherwise I suggest that you
find another supply for the LEDs.  Another idea to consider is to make the
LEDs flicker (at something near 40 kHz, then design an AC amplifier for your
sensor circuit.  You might find a much better performance.

Good Luck,
Pherd

 the IR sensor is sharing the same +5V source and the same ground. but when i
 assembly 16 of them together, the habdyboard will immediately switch to
 reset mode. so i tried to troubleshoot by only connecting the digital sensor
 port and it works. but after about 2mins, the HB switch to reset mode again.
 the same situation happen when i tried with the analog port only.
 
 i like to know what is wrong and how to solve. could it be the wire is short
 or the circuitry is faulty? or could it be the HB cannot supply enough
 current to the sensors ? 
 please help! i am really at my wits end.

www. columbia-center.org/fascinating/index html    This company has a

especially interesting and adaptable to the handy board by some one a whole

not really.  you can issue serial line characters to the desktop PC
from the HB (see the FAQ), but IC cannot display them.

so, for interactive development, it won't work.  but if you can quit
IC and run a terminal emulator program on your PC (e.g.,
HyperTerminal, ZTerm), then it can be done.

see the FAQ:

Hi!

Some time ago i asked this question now i try again, maybe anybody can help
me!

I dowloaded the environment for the pc(dos) to assemble a s19-pcode file
for the hb.
Now i tried a little bit but it does now work,

What you can download under 

pcode for hb and makefile 
http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/icsourc
e.html

and
http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/util.ht
ml

''as11_ic for MS-DOS. Compile ICB (Interactive C Binary driver) files on
your MS-DOS machine, using Kent Farnsworth's package of tools. The tools
allow you to assemble the pcode.s19 file (which runs on the Handy Board's
6811) as well as compile ICB files''

 seems not fit together. The pc package alone does work fine but i have no
rev22 board to test the s19.
If i use the pcode from above i does translate after some changed
equivalent to the ones in the pcode from the
pc-package. But this pcode.s19 does not boot correctly and cannot handle
the display.

I think there are three possibilities - the as11 does produce not the
correct code, the pcode is not correct or
i made a mistake in changing the hb pcode.

Has anybody a running hb pcode so i can sure that there is no error or does
anybody compile/assemble 
his own pcode with the pc-package?

Bye
Bernd

Howdy,

I've been playing with my HB for about a month now, and after reading all the 
documentation again, I was able to solve the newbie questions that I have 
posted few weeks ago...

But now, I'm stuck with serioal I/O :)

Could someone help me answering any/some/all of the questions below, please ?  
Also, I'd like to suggest the inclusion of these Q&A to the FAQ...

Thank you in advance, 

Andre Philippi.


Serial Communication Clarifications for Newbies
###############################################

1 - In regards to pa7i9600.icb :
================================

1.1) How to use pa7i9600.icb ? What is the C interface for the driver ? 

1.2) Can I use it to get serial input ?

1.3) WHat TTL stands for ? What is the difference from Inverted TTL ?

1.4) Examples of TTL, and Inverted TTL devices ? Or... Which devices are TTL, 
or Inverted TTL (Modem, RF-Link, Mini-SSC, etc...) ?


2 - In regards to serialio.c :
==============================

2.1) With another HB:
---------------------
2.1.1) Since the FAQ's cable diagrams display RJ11 connectors, 
does it mean that I should discard the interface/chargers on both 
handyboards, and connect them directly with the RJ11 cable only ?

2.1.2) Could I connect 2 HBs using their respectives interface/chargers,
and a regular DB-9 RS-232 cable ?


2.2) With PC:
-------------
2.2.1) Is the procedure the same as for connecting 2 HBs together ?

2.2.2) If the above is right, then I should discard the interface/charger, 
right?

2.2.3) If the above is true, then the cable is gonna be an RJ11-DB-9, right ?

2.2.4) If the procedure is not the same as for connecting 2 HBs, then
should I use the interface/charger when connecting to a PC's DB-9 RS-232
serial port ?

2.2.5) If I should use the interface/charger, are there any special 
considerations in regards to the cabling, or could I just use a regular
db-9 RS-232 serial cable ?

2.2.5) Just out of curiosity... Could I discard the interface/charger,
and connect the HB straight to the PC's RS-232 DB-9 serial port ?
 
 
2.3) With another serial device (Modem, RF-Link, Mini-SSC, etc...):
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2.3.1) Some serial devices use RJ11 (Mini-SSC), while others use
DB-9 RS-232. Should I always use the interface/charger ?

2.3.2) Can I always use a regular DB-9 RS-232 cable, with the proper
connector (RJ11 or DB-9) at the ends ?


3 - In regards to serial communications in general :
====================================================

3.1) Is there a way to connect a wireless modem directly to the interface/charger (or directly to the HB), and make it work ? 

3.2) Has anybody made this (http://www.vermontlife.com/gary/crystal.html) Embedded 10BaseT Ethernet board to work with the HB yet?

like to hear your design and what kind of major problems that you 
encountered in building it.  A website would be great.  The reason for my 
interest is that I need to include any "prior research" for my science

If you use icc11 (a cross compiler, not an interpreted compiler) for the
handyboard (they have a library for controlling the handyboard) then
printf() calls write to the PC and lcd_write calls write to the LCD. 
--Chuck

icc11 is available from www.imagecraft.com relatively inexpensively.

Hi all,

Does anyone know how to get a the interrupt line on the handyboard.

Been looking at the documentation, and was a bit surprised that the 
interrupt was not available.

Am I missing something?

We have developed a library of functions so that one can write HB-style
code and run it either on the HB or compile it with the library and run
it on a PC. It hasn't been thoroughly debugged, but works consistently
(There are some timing issues that need to be fixed.) It implements the
basic functions (reading sensors, controlling motors, making sounds,
printing to the LCD) but none of the threads, etc. The printf from the
HB was changed to "print" so that "printf" is the standard printf on the
PC. A couple of small changes, but most code which runs on the HB can
run on the PC.

You can find it at: http://brainstem.uark.edu/software/ under the
HandyBoard section.

We use this system so that we can integrate vision with our
Handyboard-based robots relatively painlessly (we use Quickcams which
have a lot of support under Linux and Windows).

    I could really use some help connecting a Futaba 3101 microservo.  I
bought the micro servo to reduce the weight instead of the standard S148
servo.  Anyway, I connected the red line to the HB +5V supply on the SPI
expansion header.  The black wire to the -Batt connection on the power
expansion header and the white control to digital input 9 on the top row.  I
loaded the file servo_a7.icb onto the board.  However the servo keeps using
it's full travel and then binding at the end causing too much current to be
drawn and resetting the board (I am running the board off a 9V battery to
save weight.)  I tried changed the servo_a7_pulse constant to many different
values but could not find the correct range.  Has anyone connected this
servo to the HB before or know what I am doing wrong?  Thanks

try running the servo off of a separate power supply; e.g., 4 AA
cells.  you'd connect the servo red wire to the battery + lead, the servo
black wire to the battery - lead, and also connect the battery - lead
to the HB motor ground.

in general it is a bad idea to power a servo off of the HB's regulated
+5v supply.

the label on the diagram says "cut motor trace here" with an arrow
that points to a dark band.

if you look at your HB, it won't have a dark band.  that's where you
need to cut.  slice through the green-coated trace where that dark
band on the picture is.

what is the amp-hour rating of each cell.  standard AA rechargables
are 500 to 800 mAh.  if your cells are significantly different than
this, the charging might not work properly.

generally though i don't see too many probs with this.  you might need
to use a 15v DC adapter rather than 12v.

I don't have IC handy, but you should just be able to do
a hard cast.
float aFloat = 1.3;
int   anInteger = 0;
anInteger = (int) aFloat; /*cast the float to an int */

/*you can also do it in a function call*/
FuntionTakesAnInt( (int) aFloat );

Hope this helps!

 Through reading every day e_mails, I have been led to beleive that I 
have to be carefull in choosing a servo motor brand, so could any body 
help me in choosing a servo for my application which is a position 
control,I mean a ref. and a supplier address.

Thanx.

I own an handy-board now for 2 months and
I have now 2 GP2D02 connected to it. (took me 1 hour to hook them up and
test)
You need a digital output-pin(like one off the spi-pins) or
make use of the expansion-board, which has digital outputs.
I created my own expansion board with 16 digitial out, 16 analog in and 8
digital in.
I make use of a like wise pgm as found on:
http://arielle.informatik.uni-kl.de/Lehre/Praktikum/PSD-IC.html
Doing the High/Low setting of Vin is done differently than this example,
because
they use a peculiar, but interesting way of doing digital output.
When you are interested I can post you my source.

BTW the differences in readings on the same distance between the 2 PSDs is
quite large.
A reading on 50cm differs 16.
This means that when you are interested in the absolute distance, you need
to build specific
lookup tables per PSD.

Hello Folks-

A couple of months ago I built a HB with the exception of one part...

U15 (Sharp IS1U60 infrared demodulator)

... I now have the need.

I am looking for the info for a supplier or individual that will sell a
small number(2).  I'm in the Massachusetts area, and will come and get
them.

Thanks!
Steve.

If anyone who has successfully interfaced the GP2D02 to the

I ordered these sensors at Gleasonresearch in a sensor pack,
but where can i buy them without other stuff...
I need about 4 of these:
they look like this:
   ______
  /  __  \
 /  I__I  \
/__________\
  I I  I I
  I I  I I
  I I  I I
  I I  I I
  I I  I I

AND then i have an other question...
2 weeks ago i wrote a programm for the HB with a little LOOP
it worked fine, but after a while it stopped
and on the LCD-Display stood "RUNTIME ERR" or s.th. like this
then i did a BEEP(); into the LOOP und then it worked fine 
without this error... what could it be??

You can do this in IC 3.2, perhaps not in the freeware version.

Hi all

Iam thinking about making a six legged walking robot using servos and
wondered if anybody has already built one.
I want to use two servos per leg one for lifting and another for the
sweeping action so giving 12 in total. One thing i want to know is how do
you control twelve servos? i have seen some serial servo controllers that
control upto 256, is  it possible to control them with just the handyboard.
also does the HB have enough proccessing power to control all these servos
and still have enough spare for obstical avoidance etc.



Any thoughts, tips etc.

Thanks Russ....

I previously posted information on the list about the controller and
chassis that I am intending on using for my six legged walker so
checking the archives may be useful.
I am using an MSCC11 from Novasoft as a servo controller, I don't
believe the HB on it's own can handle the workload of controlling 12
servos without help. The MSCC11 is also HC11 based and it is loaded with
a servo controller program which is specifically designed to control a
six legged walkers servos. It can actually control a total of 16 servos
but only 12 are used for walking. The HB communicates with the
controller via a standard serial comms. The controller only requires
input so you could use the software write to drive a serial line from
one of the output pins. If you are going to use a standard serial cable
(ie. bi-directional comms) the controller can also return analogue
values.
I haven't built the walker yet as I need more servos and I need a few
more components to finish the HB but running the controller from a PC
with a terminal emulator the controller works with very little input
from the PC so when using the HB you would be able to have it doing
other things.
If you want any more info you can contact me direct or via the list.

Hope this helps.

I believe the best thing to do is use separte controlers (e.g. PICs) to
control the specific motions of the servo's. This will allow you to have
more control over the HB. There are several places on the web (e.g.
http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/pic/  where you can find info on PIC's
including having them control servo's. I think the timing constraints on
12 servo's will heavily tax the HB resources.

The only problem with using individual servo control is speed, the time
it takes to move 12 servos by individual commands is rather long. This
has the effect of slowing the walker down considerably. A dedicated
controller such as the MSCC11 that I mentioned previously moves all the
servos at the same time thus increasing the movement speed (admittedly
this will probably not be very quick no matter what you use, I think I
worked it out to be approximately 2 mile per hour max but my maths could
be wrong).

Timing 12 servos with the HB could be done. So far we are using 8 servos
which don't use much cpu resources at all. But 1 compare output can only
time 8 servos because of the servos timing requierments without using a lot
of cpu time. So a second compare output must be used for the other 4 servos.
But using a clever algorithm timing 12 servos could be done.
The biggest problem is to get all the contol algorithms to run for 12 servos
(12 axes) in realtime.
It could be done using multiple handyboards.

I'm very interested in your project, so please keep posting ideas and
information about your WALKER.

I have been researching this exact topic for almost a year now. I started off
looking at the Handyboard do to its popularity and strong robotic application
design but ultimately I've decided to use one or more Atmel processors do to
their speed and variety of models. I am seriously looking at using one of their
20 pin versions to control each pair of legs where each leg has 3 degrees of
freedom instead of your thoughts of only 2 DOF. If you were to adopt a similar
approach of designing intelligent leg controllers this would move much of the
tedious (read "CPU hog") process off the Handyboard and then it could be a better
central brain and leg "coordinator."

Since it looks like you are near the beginning of your research and design I'll
share some of my personal views. The leg lift motors must be very strong but
not as fast as the swing motor. This is because in the fastest gait, an alternateing
tripod gait, each middle leg must support half of the weight of the robot and
this is cantilevered thus amplifying the weight. If you never plan to do an
alternating tripod gait then you can reduce the strength of the lift motor because
each side of the hexapod will always have 2 legs on the ground at the same time
and so must only support one forth the weight of the bot, BUT it will travel
at 1/3 the speed of the tripod gait.

I am opting to try to put all my actuators (motor) at the hip joint to reduce
the moments of inertia. This should let me move the legs somewhat quicker than
if some of the motors were located at the knee. This choice also increases the
weight that the lift motors must deal with so it is a trade-off.

Hobby style servos can get very expensive to match the speed and torque reqirements
of even a very small walker. In my case I think I can use 2 standard (42 oz.inch)
servos (cost $10 each for cheapos and $20 each for brandname ball bearing variety)
and 1 high torque (90-100 oz,inch costing about $60). If I want the high speed
versions (.12 sec for 60 degrees instead of .22 sec) it will almost double the
cost of the servos but will also double the walking speed. My original goal
was for an 18-22 inch hexapod to have a max speed of about 2 mph which equates
to 6 six inch steps every second! there are NO hobby style servos that can come
even close. So the next best option is about 1/3 my orginal goal and plan to
redesign the legs in the future using geared DC motors instead of hobby servos
which lets me gear them to fit the need and use really fast motors.

If you care to discuss this topic any further contact me directly since we may
be staying somewhat off topic, unless there is enough interest on this list
to continue and the powers that be, Fred(?), think it would be appropriate to
discuss this here. I am interested in communicating with anyone out there that
may be doing anything even remotely associated with this.

Subject: New mail list for legged robots
X-Mailer: DMailWeb Web to Mail Gateway 2.0n, http://netwinsite.com/top_mail.htm
Message-Id: <36964543.2c42.0@wt.net>

I decided to jump off the deep end and have created a new mail list for anyone
interested in legged/walking robots regardless of CPU or "brain board". You
can join this list by sending a mail message to

      legged-robots-subscribe@egroups.com

or you can visit the site

      http://www.egroups.com/list/legged-robots/

This will be where the archive will reside.

An email message with instructions will be sent to you. Since this is a new
list I don't know how busy it will be but it should be interesting. I will forward
the last few messages from here that deal with this subject.

Mike

All-

Ok, I'll re-phrase..... Does anyone have the name and supplier of a
substitute (for the Sharp IS1U60 infrared demodulator) that they have
gotten to work reliably?

Thanks.

I want to program my  HB so that my robot will be able to navigate around obstacles. The navigation 
area is a rectangular area boarded by a silver duct tape. My robot shall not touch the tape. Does 
anyone have any idea of how I can implement this? What kind of sensor should I use so that my robot 
will stay within this rectangulaer area without touching the silver duct tape?

if your robot is not allowed to even partially cross the duct tape,
you must have an additional inner marking that the robot can see so it
knows it's near the "danger zone" and can change direction.

I recently purchased the Handy Board 1.2 and am running the HC11E1FN.  I
also purchased the IC compiler from Newton Research Labs.  Everything worked
great.

I hooked up a hobby servo to PA7 and it ran well with the supplied c
routines.  However, after disconnecting the servo, when I tried to use PA7
to develop some sonar routines, it wouldn't respond to the following code:

Bit_set(0x1026, 0b10000000);
Bit_set(0x1000, 0b10000000);

I checked it with the vom and it stayed low the whole time even during
interactive commands.  Then I ran the testdigitals() function in the
hbtest.c set and the digital input 2 (starting with 0) would show logic 1
(active low) regardless of what I did.

Now this morning, when I turn on the power, all I get is a clicking sound
from the piezo speaker.

I have exhaustively looked for shorts and poor solders.  I have re-soldered
5 or 10 pins just to make sure.  I swapped out the 74HC244 to see if he was
the culprit, no avail.

Can anyone give me some steps from here?  Ask me some questions, I'm
stumped.

Thanks.

Hello,
	Does anyone here know how acceleration will affect the operaion of
a handyboard, and also will sudden changes in altitude (like, 3,000 feet
in less than ten seconds) affect it's operation? I have a High Power
Rocketry launch coming up in May, and I'm desinging a payload that will be
controlled/documented by my HB so I need to know how much the HB can take.

	And no, it is *not* a guided missile with a warhead!

I presume that you are not planning on using my infrared control software!
Good luck in your project, it sounds like fun.  Wanna tell us more about it?

   I put together the HB shortly after it first became available.   This is
key because it worked-downloading and  all.
   I put it down for a year because of family problems but all that time left
it plugged in because of the Ni-cad.   I feel that should make no difference
but now to the problem.   IT WILL not tale a download no how no way.   My MAC
OS  8 comjper will not see the Handy Board or often will load 255 bytes but
not the 256th-the last one.
  If one tried 15 times the init board from the Freeware IC it would take that
so I was running IC 2.81 1993.
  I then got the Commercial; version from Newton Labs and now nothing.
Interestingly-and maybe a pointer to the problem-with the IC3.1-when I try to
reload the P code-the HB's green light will NOT go out as it must for the HB
to be in Downloadmode.(IT still stays on for a 1/3 of sec. with the freeware
version but will not take DL anymore no matter how many times I try.   I just
bought a new telephone 4 wire cable-it makes no difference.

  When you try a DL you see the blinking green light on the serial interface-
the Maxam chip seems to have the proper voltages.    

 I  STUMPED-bad 32k memory? The only other clue was using the the MC
downloader-and at one point I got an error message  Apple talk driver open
error-port not configured-but Apple talk was not on nor is it ever.  I have
not been the MC dopwnloader-I just tried it to see-  none of the DLer maske
any difference

  Any help Greatly appreciated   Cappy Anderson

Hi all,

Is it possible to add more motor ports to the handy board by simply copying
the existing
motor drive circuit and putting them on the expansion header where the extra
chip select lines are.
if so what changes would be needed to make IC motor() functions control the
extra ports, and what
impact would this be on the CPU resources.

I need to control 12 individual motors and maybe 18 in the future.


Cheers Russ.....

dear fred and readers

my motors is 30V.
i am using the external batteries as instructed on the website. but i
cant control the motor speed using the command: motor(0,...)  i then
remove the external batts and supply power to the other power pts(top
left hand corner of the board).
i noticed as i increase the voltage supply, my motor then turns faster.
however is there a way to controlthe motor spd by program instead of
inceasing the voltage supply. and which motor ports should i use, the
external ports or the pts on the top left hand corner?

plese reply to me soon
thank u.

	Most likely not, Max, unless I save up a lot of money and get a
daVinci organizer or something like that and write up a donwlink
program... :-)

	There's this thing here in Wisconsin (And in Michigan and Iowa)
called "Rockets for Schools" It lets students launch high power rockets,
rockets with motors that need special certification because of their high
power. So I have this 5 foot tall rocket sitting above my desk that we
flew last year with a radio transmitter in it just to hear the motor fire.
this year, I want to desing a payload to analyze the flight, etc. things
like the spinrate of the vehicle, possibly acceleration, and perhaps
monitoring some other things like temperature. Just wanted to make sure
the HB was up for the job. 
	Just FYI, rockets for schools is a REALLY neat thing! They launch
the rocket for $50, that includes 2 days worth of fun. There are some
rocket and electronic vendors, information groups and college recruiters
there. Not to mention watching a SuperLoki launch (it's a big old sounding
rocket).....

Hi Philsky;

I've seen videos of some of these "serious amateur" rocket launches, and
from that I would say acceleration is your prime concern, followed by shock
and vibration.  I'm assuming you will substitute a lightweight 9V lithium
battery for the NiCd battery pack, and that you will remove the LCD and use
the "NoLCD" version of the P-code.

Beyond that, I would mount the thing flat so the G-forces won't tend to pull
the chips from their sockets, and you might want to consider soldering as
many of the external connections as possible, rather than relying on
connectors.  Go to an R/C shop and buy some of the foam rubber they sell
there specifically for protecting R/C receivers and wrap the HB with that.

Some additional considerations:  If you don't need the motor-driver or IR
features of the HB you might want to consider the Fingerboard, which is
basically a Handyboard without the peripherals (you can add whatever ports
etc. you actually need).  The Fingerboard is thus smaller and lighter,
however not any more shock or vibration resistant.  You could also "pot" the
HB (or the FB) with RTV silicone, but this makes parts replacement more
difficult, and won't dissipate heat.  You also might want to think up ways
to torture test your rig beforehand.  Tie it to a rope and twirl it round
your head?  Bungee drop it from a building?  Finally, if you plan to use R/C
or telemetry with this rocket, be aware that the HB generates a lot of RF
noise, so you  may have to experiment with shielding.  Dealing with EMI and
RFI is a black art, understood by few, and requires much experimenting.

I recently built a small data-logger using a Fingerboard wrapped in
fishpaper and R/C foam for use on mountain bikes and all-terrain-vehicles,
but weather has prevented any serious teating.  Preliminary tests were
promising, though.

Hi,

   this must have been asked before. But where can I get the TI SN754410
from On-line ordering if possible or a UK supplier.
   I managed burn one out  on my Handy Board at the weekend :o(  is
there a way to protect these chips from motors that take too much power?

   all help welcome

thanks

There is nothing wrong with using fuses (or circuit breakers) on motor
circuits.  This can protect the chips, AND the motor.

I'm building a theory about how to make a 360 range finding system.  It only
needs to be accurate out to, say, a foot or 18 inches.  basically it's a
"before you bump" bump system.

I've thought of using a series of IR emitters/detectors in a circular
fashion.  Then timing a pulse from each emitter and waiting for the detector
to fire off, and return the value (resistance) to the HB's analog input.  I
only want to use one input for this, not all of the 8 inputs, which would
probably make the project easier, then I'd just have to do the polling in
software.

So, here's what I think i need:

8 IR detectors/emitters. to cover a rough 360 degree view.
A circuit to switch between each detector/emitter pair.
A timing device to fire off the IR emitter and a latch to hold the value
coming off of the detector.

However, I also need to know which detector did the detecting.  So, the
switching mechanism would set a value (binary counter?) to indicate which
detector is active, or more accurately, which detector the value on the
latch/buffer belongs to.

I'm thinking this might be better done as a serial interface design, that
way you could pass the detector number, followed by the value of the
detector.

If someone has already done this, please send me your link to your website
or some readme files.  I know this can be done, but with my crippled
knowledge of electronics, i'll have to rely on your brainpower to get me
through this....

I'm also very interested in using UCOS in HB.
IC is very slow and have very stupid multitasking.

Until now I find only basic HB library  for  ICC11
(http://www.imagecraft.com/software/devtools.html)

This  library  is  at  ftp://ftp.imagecraft.com/pub/libhb.zip

It  may  by  usable  with  UCOS.

Russ,

This would not suffice.  The PCODE would need to be changed as well.

The end result of the motor interface routines in C in LIB_HB.C is that
RAM locations 0x0E, and 0x22-0x25 have the direction and speed pattern info
for each of the four motors.  The PCODE then apparently does the shifting of
the speed patterns through each of the motor ports synchronous to the 1ms 
interrupt.  

If you added the hardware for the additional motoros and butchered up the
LIB_HB.C routines to accommodate them, you'd still to have an interrupt
routine which would take the info for each of the new motors and shift 
them through at the 1ms rate.  

If you use the public domain IC, you could do this directly in the PCODE ASM
source file.  If you use the commercial IC 3.2, you'll have to write an ICB
file to handle it since the PCODE source is not available as far as I know.

Hi all,

Is it possible to add more motor ports to the handy board by simply copying
the existing
motor drive circuit and putting them on the expansion header where the extra
chip select lines are.
if so what changes would be needed to make IC motor() functions control the
extra ports, and what
impact would this be on the CPU resources.

I need to control 12 individual motors and maybe 18 in the future.


Cheers Russ.....

I have some questions about the handyboard memory:

1) Does it matter if i use a 70ns Eprom instead of the 100ns one?
2) Can you use EEproms or FlashRoms instead of the Eprom ?
3) Can i use more memory than the 256 KB ?

And is there a exchange transistor type for the ZTX614 (IR-Output) ?
And which type of IR-Transmiters do i need ?

Russell,
     Just a suggestion from experience.  Before you invest a lot of time
developing hardware to expand the capability of the Handy Board, I suggest you
write the program.  Just "stub out" the motors you don't have with dummy
subroutines, or for more accurate timing, remap those calls to the existing
motor ports.  Your goal is to see if the program that you write can control
all the motors in your design in a timely maner.  I call this the easy part
since you should already have everything you need for it (the Handy Board, and
IC).  I once built a Z-80 robot controller whith hardware to implement the
full 256 I/O ports.  I then wrote software to control the speed of two drive
wheels using pulse width modulation.  I didn't have much of a hardware timer
(just a free running hardware clock), so my control program used 75% of the
CPU time just controling those two motors.  I didn't have enough time for the
big job of planning what those motors were to do (where the robot goes).  I
have since learned PIC programming.

Hope this saves time
Pherd

Dear Friends,
	    We, at VESIT ,Bombay,India are making a rover which is capable
 of navigating itself and avoiding obstacles.For this,we are using the 
handy board.The soldering work has been completed and we are now trying to 
use 'download software' with it.
	    In the handy board assembly manual it has been said that 
inorder to check the charger/interfacing circuit, connect only the that 
circuit(charger/interfacer) without the handy board to the host computer 
using a appropriate modem cable (RS232).Then the charger/interface board
has to be powered causing the red LED(PWR) to glow. Next,the download 
software has to be run. At this stage the green LED on the board should
glow up indicating transmission of data (or readiness to transmit data).We
are finding that the green LED(SER) does not glow in our circuit.(please
refer to section 3.3.2 of the hba.pdf file for more explanation)
	    We are therefore unable to find whether this particular board 
is working and hence we cannot risk connecting the handy board to the 
charger/interfacer board.
	    Can someone please tell me what are the possible reasons causing
this to occur?Please reply as soon as possible as we have to begin testing
the program to run the rover.
							Yours Sincerely,
							    Nitin

I obtained the RF wireless kit ( HP Series )  from Lynx Technologies a while
ago, and I have not had any success yet. My guess is that the handyboard is
unable to "Synchronize with the board" with the half- duplex communication
provided by the kit.
I contacted Lynx Technologies by e-mail about the application, and they
provided me with a tech support number. I plan to contact them as soon as
possible.
Meanwhile, I heard that somebody had already had success with the wireless
link using a kit by Radiometrix? I have lost the link to the site.

Attached below is IC code for a GP2D02 rangefinder. This is a slightly
enhanced version of code from Bjorn Astrand. My question relates to
the use of TMSK1 in the code. From reading various M69HC11 documents,
I think (???) that I know what bits are being set but I do NOT understand
why this is being done. If someone would help me understand the
necessity of using TMSK1 for this routine, I would be grateful. If you
see other problems in the code, please let me know. Thanks!

   The GP2D02 must be connected with Vin attached to MISO and Vout
   attached to MOSI (port D pins).

   Note: Vin is connected to MISO through a simple voltage divider

This can take a long time.
Start by making sure that the cable is correct. You can do this by
changing the Rx and Tx lines. If this does not help de Maxim serial
driver can be faulty. Last check the solder joints.I once looked at them
and could not see anything wrong. I reheated them with a soldering iron
and it worked.

Good luck

 hi
    i've recently modified the pcode.asm file to make the timer interrupt 
    occur at 2KHz, rather than 1KHz. does anyone know how i'm supposed
    to assemble/compile this pcode.asm file into the pcode_hb.s19 file
    that will be loaded into the Handyboard? if memory serves me correctly,
    there are specific assembly language compilers. can anyone recommend
    a good site to download such softwares?

The most common problems seem to be with the types of cables and the
serial port settings.  Make sure that you are using a straight through
cable (not a null modem cable) to connect the HB to the serial port, and
make sure that you have a telephone style RJ11 cable (not a network
style RJ11 cable) to connect the serial interface board to the HB.

Also, try to verify that your serial port is working properly.  If you
have multiple serial ports, try it on different ones (I had success with
one port, but not the other).  The following settings are ones that work
with my HB.

   Bits per second:  9600
   Data bits:        8
   Parity:           none
   Stop bits:        1
   Flow control:     Xon/Xoff

You say that you haven't yet tried connecting the HB to the serial
interface board.  Perhaps others on the mailing list can address whether
it would be too risky to simply try hooking up the HB at this point and
testing the whole system (despite the fact that the serial interface
board may not be working properly yet).  Since I'm not very smart about
electronics, I would probably just plug it all in and see if it smokes! 
;-)

Good luck.

The interface charger board is soldered and the max232  chip has been tested
works perfectly and the green led SER glows on shorting the pind of max232
and the J3 socket. But when the host computer is connected and the proper
downloaded is connected it says that board not in proper mode. This is
justified as the board is not in bootstrap. But the green doesnt  glow at
all. What can be the error. We cheacked the connections, cable, the
downloader and everything else. cant find the fault please reply soon

Hi all, I am assembling a handyboard and things have gone well until I got
to the section 7.1.1 in the assembly manual. I assembled the digital
inputs, and when I used the function testdigitals(), the start button is
the only one that will register a 1 on the screen while testing all of the
inputs.  I have checked pin 9 of U6(74HC138) and it is stuck on logical
high rather than pulsing like it should be doing. Any suggesions?

Thanks in advance,

Owen Popplestone

Re Serial interface problems in Bombay


When  I assembled the inteface board, I made the mistake of putting a male
connector on the interface board. I had the same problems as you and this
turned out to be the obvious cause.... so double check all your work and
check for correct parts.

Good luck!

thank you for the apt and quick reply. if you could tell us what is the
difference between a straight through cable and a null modem cable it would
be great( we are using a 25 female to 25 female connector) and how to
identify the difference between the RJ11 telephone and network cable. We
have checked the cable and it looks to be a 4 wire telephone cable since I
removed it from my telephone directly. Also, the handy board once connected
receives power form the charger board but does not enter BOOTSTRAP MODE. The
PWR and BATT led do not go on and off. But the yellow CHARGE LED on the
interface board keeps on switching if the hb is connected and then lights up
constantly when the STOP switch is pressed. Since, the bootstrap
configuration is not confirmed we cannot download the program: but on trying
the downloader it gives ERROR which might be due to cable fault as suggested
earlier.
Please help debug
thank you

milind,
     To check your phone cord, hold the ends together so that the wires are
away from each other.  Look through the clear connector.  The wire colors
should line up in this orientation.  
     There is a little more to the DB-25 issue.  "Null modem" vs. "straight
through" has two important differences.  The one that is probably bothering
you has to do with the ordering of pins 2 and 3 (Tx and Rx).  The "straight
through" cable does not swap the order of the wires.  It is designed to go
between a computer and a modem.  One transmits on pin 2 and the other receives
on pin 2.  A "null modem" cable is designed to connect two "computer" type
devices who both transmit on pin 2 (or is it pin 3, no matter).  This type of
cable swaps pins 2 and 3 at the connectors.  Another important function of the
null modem cable is to be sure "data terminal ready" and "clear to send" are
held at appropriate levels.  There are a couple of ways to do this.  I make
them by having one conector (the computer end) with a jumper shorting pins 4
to 5 and another jumper shorting pins 6, 8, and 20.  These "null modem" cables
became popular when the IBM PC came out.  Before that most computer (micros
any way) didn't look at those pins and you only had to worry about pins 2 and
3.  But the PC would not transmit unless CTS and DTR were set.
     If you look on page 59 of the technical manual you will see that pins
5,6, and 20 are shorted together to take care of CTS and DTR.  So I would
guess that your serial cable should pass lines 2,3,5,6,7, and 20.  Be sure
that your cable has these and does not swap pins 2 and 3.  If not pull out a
soldering iron.  If 2 and 3 are swapped, swap them back. If 5,6 and 20 are not
passed through, jumper them on the computer end.  I just checked my cables and
pin 2 on the computer end (female) does go to pin 2 on the Handy board end
(male).  A paper clip will help get a meter probe into those female pin holes.

Hope this helps
Pherd

Subject: FingerBoard Users?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I want to add a minimal board as a slave to my HandyBoard.  My
choices seem to be the FingerBoard, MiniBoard, and BOTBoard.

At this point the FingerBoard is my first choice.  Is there anyone
here who has used this board?  Any comments? Pros and cons of
each board?

Thanks,

I don't know of a supplier for the SN754410, but the originally
specified L239D is readily available from:

Maplins (code No. AH80B) for 3.99 UKP inc VAT, or

Farnell (code No. 699809) for 5.04 UKP + VAT

Both of these  companies  have UK websites.

Hope this helps

If you can't find the TI chip try doubling up on the L293D by piggybacking them
on top of each other for added amps. You can use one L293D with an additional
L293 on top of it (the 'D' has protection diodes that you MUST have). You may
need to provide motor power to the chip separately because the traces on the
Handyboard may not handle that much current (from a previous discussion, I do
not know firsthand)

Hi Everybody,

I'm trying to hook-up the Handy Board, an R/C car chassis, and a wireless camera

1 - Is the whole thing correct, from an EE stand point ?
2 - Is there a problem in having a battery with far more Amps than necessary? 
3 - Could a battery with high Amperage "push" too much current ?
4 - Could the R/C DC motors draw too much current and "harm " the HB ?
5 - What kind of dynamo/combustion motor (r/c) size, combination would be
    necessary to feed a 12v in/out battery recharger (with auto trickle charge)?

Thank you in advance,

Andre Philippi.

I have Quick Time movies of my robot going about life!

visit: www.cooper.edu/~mar

Background:
	As a Masters student I created a mobile robot using the Handy 
Board.  Many of you may remeber me bugging you with questions.  :)  Well, 
that all payed off and I had a successful project and presentation.  
Thanks to all who helped!  I decided to document my work so that others 
may see and learn from it.  It took quite a while but finally...

	In the documentaion there are video demos of subsumption and 
robot fire-fighting mimicking the reknown Trinity College Fire Fighting 
Home Robot Contest.  Brief explanations of principles are included.

Enjoy!

Hi friends,

Sorry if this subject isn't much related to the Handy Board, but I'd like to
know something about the HC11 Eprom based microcontrollers, like the
MC68hc11a8p.

Does it have any means of booting from the serial port and save the program
in its eprom by itself? Or do I need a special programmer to put software in
it? If this is the case, is it much difficult to build?

Thank you a lot for the attention.

See you,
Cesar

The main problem I see is with how you label the voltages at various
points in the circuit.  If you have a 12 V battery, the low voltage end
is usually called zero volts and the high voltage end is called +12
volts (although the numbers are just relative to each other).  You show
-12 V at one end and +12 V at the other, which you could only get with a
24 V source (which wouldn't be appropriate).  Perhaps the following
would make more sense:

                                        +12V

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi,

i am looking for a program to use the knob for scrolling through
messages.
i really need this, because i have to output more than 32 chars (and
there isnt enough space for a larger display ).
i have read about using the knob for scrolling on the handyboard
website.

anyone already written such a program ?

Thanks, Simon

Yes, and it is totally trivial to do so.  I don't have my sources here at
the moment, but it is roughly like this:


c = readknob();  /* or whatever the cmd is for reading it */

if ( c < 64 )
{
  print "a";
}
else if ( c < 128 )
{
  print "b";
}
else if ( c < 192 )
{
  print "c";
}
else
{
  print "d";
}

or set a variable inside each if block and then run through a switch
statement later when you're doing your printing.

Sorry if my C is rusty.  I do too many languages nowadays...

Simon,

This shouldn't be too difficult to create...but it could be a real waste of
memory unless it is real important issue.

The reason why is that you would have to save the messages in memory.  You'd
have to decide if you wanted to fill all the memory, or limit it to just xx
number of lines/messages.

I'm not the best programmer but I'd probably create a function that I would
call each time I was to do a printf().  This function would be passed the
value of the string to printf() and would store it in memory (an array, a
stack, or a linked list...I'm not sure which would be best).  Then, based upon
the number of lines/messages, you would relate that number to the 0-255 range
of the display.

What would you want to do while scrolling the messages and halfway, when the
HB sends another Printf?  I'd suggest using the start, or stop switch to put
it into scroll mode. then pressing it again takes it out of scroll mode and
restores the display to the last active message.

What do you think?

Gerald

Hi all!

I got a question.

Whenever I connect the motor outputs to a scope (I wanted to read the output of
the HB), the LEDs light up even with the output off (ao())...

Can anyone explain this to me?

Thanks.

Keith

In the example, are there any advantages or disadvantages in using a voltage
regulator (such as a 7805) to dropping the voltage from 12v to 5v as opposed
to using a diode string?  

Also, I guess no one had an answer on the earlier question of running the HB
in a continuous-power mode (ie from a wall-wart).  I would be intersted in
knowing an answer to this as well if anyone has an idea.  If the HB was
constantly doing something (or at some frequency, I assume the trickle
charge mode would be good to keep the battery going.  But, I can't imagine
it would be good for the unit to sit on the charger idle for days at a time.

I apologize for having sent the following with extra line-feeds in it;
Here it is again:

The main problem I see is with how you label the voltages at various
points in the circuit.  If you have a 12 V battery, the low voltage end
is usually called zero volts and the high voltage end is called +12
volts (although the numbers are just relative to each other).  You show
-12 V at one end and +12 V at the other, which you could only get with a
24 V source (which wouldn't be appropriate).  Perhaps the following
would make more sense:

                                        
                                        +12V            +---------------+

Never done it before, Alf, but here are a few hints. First off, learn
about the IDE interface. These CD-ROM drives are cheaper than SCSI. Also,
try to find source code for a CD player on-line, and examine it to see
how it works. Last, why not just buy a CD player? You could then
hardwire it to the HB and could skip this all.

thanks to the immediate responses from the mailing list I was able to remove
the connector bug from my handy bosrd and now my interface board is
complete.
But the handy board does not enter the download mode
The sitution is as follows:
Once I provide power to the handy board thru the interface board the red
BATT led goes ON and then goes OFF. The PWR led also goes ON.
If I press the stop switch and provide power to the board the red BATT led
goes on for a brief instant and then goes off as required; but the green PWR
led remains ON. This indicates that the board is not in download mode. I
checked the output voltages at the MOD A and MOD B pins of the 6811 and when
the STOP switch is pressed, the levels are 0 and 0 on both pins indicating
that the 6811 enters the required special bootstrap mode. Once the switch is
released the voltages are 1.4V and 0 V on MOD A  and MOD B pin.

I have also tried to run the downloading software: the green SER LED lights
up on the interface board and remains ON. But the software gives the error
that the board is not in required mode or there is error at port. We have
checked with various ports so I dont think that there is problem with the
port. This means that the board is not entered download mode and this is
supported by the fact that the green PWR led remains ON.

The other problem is minor but if it any indication then; the RED BATT led
goes on for a brief period when the board is switched OFF but after that the
LED partially glows. Meaning if you observe closely the LED is not
completely OFF. Also the YELLOW CHARGE LED which shouyld go ON for brief
seconds when the board goes ON and OFF does not light atall. This was not
the case before we inserted the serial line and stop switch components (ref
4.4 of "assemblying the HB") Earlier the LED used to glow ON and OFF
clearly.

We have tried the whole procedure twice on 2 different PCBs; and have met
with same results. The only 2 things that were common in both boards were
the PCB and the 6811. The 6811 I doubt is faulty as the E clock ouptput is
perfect and the PCBs are as per required design still we face the problem
again .
I am stumbed and dont know what to do!!
We have really worked hard for this project and my entire mechanical
assembly and the IC program are ready; only the HB is giving
problems..........
so please reply at the earliest
thanks in advance

By ground, I just meant the HB ground.  The important thing is just that
everything in an electronic system share the same ground; voltages are
relative, and the ground is just the shared reference point--the point
arbitrarily defined to be zero volts.  Unless your robot has spark plugs
and a CB radio, there is no need for an earth ground strap  ;-]

If you use zap charge mode, you'll end up cooking your batteries unless
the HB draws just the right amount of current.  If you use any motors or
other high current devices connected to the HB, trickle charge mode will
not supply enough current to charge the batteries, and may cause the
wall-wart to overheat after the batteries are drained.

Perhaps you could instead simply replace the battery pack with a DC
power source, regulated just enough to keep the HB voltage within
acceptable bounds across its current draw range.  A wall-wart will
probably not suffice, since the voltage would probably vary too much
(high or low) depending on current draw.  (Note:  wall-warts also seem
to waste a lot of energy in the form of heat, so unplug them when
they're not being used.)  Although it would be overkill, a power supply
from an old PC would do the trick; I've seen ones that have various
regulated voltage taps from which to choose.

The other alternative is to whump up a smart battery charger that kicks
in when the battery voltage falls below a threshold.  The safe way to
quickly recharge NiCd batteries is to ramp up the voltage supply until
the current into the batteries is somewhere in the neighborhood of
[battery capacity] / [a couple hours], but you must cease charging when
the voltage across them stops increasing.  Beyond this point, the
batteries will generate heat which will destroy 'em pretty quickly. 
Given how toxic and expensive they are, we should strive to keep NiCads
alive as long as possible.  Another (less reliable) method of charging
would cut out when a temperature sensor (glued to a battery cell with
thermal glue, perhaps) reaches a threshold.  Still, charging batteries
while the HB is drawing current will require a more sophisticated
charger than would be needed for simply charging batteries on their
own.  Hope this helps.  Best of luck to you!

check that the RxD line on the hc11 is properly pulled up to +5v
through R15.

also, make sure you are *HOLDING DOWN* the STOP button until the BATT
light goes off.  this wasn't clear from your msg.

finally, try getting the HB into boot mode with the serial adapter
board not connected.  apply power through the charge jack and leave
the RJ11 jack free.  

if you succeed in obtaining boot mode (PWR LED off but board is turned
on) with serial interface disconnected, you can be pretty certain that
problem is in your serial interface.

I recently purchased a 6500 ranging system and have connected it to the
HandyBoard (HB) 1.2 Expansion Board.  I am using IC ver 3.1 from Newton
Research Labs and loaded the sonar.c code module provided through the MIT
website.  The HB passed all testing as described in the manual and I have
successfully run servos from the expansion board plug-ins and used the IR
detector to decode my Sony TV remote and hence control the movement of the
HB rudimentary robot.   The servos have been hacked using the resistor
divider method in place of the internal position feedback pot and serve as
drive motors for the two wheel tail dragging configuration.

My next goal was installation of this ranging system and then development of
the code for object recognition and avoidance.  I have also purchased the 2X
compass module and plan to install that after this process.

My problem is that I can only get the ranging system to return a 540 to 548
value from either the sonar_sample() or sonar_closeup() routines.  One out
of five reading is say ~1200 or ~900 but the majority are right on 545 and
can range as above.  I am aware of the 1.33 foot ranging limit but this is
supposed to be compensated for when using the sonar_closeup by manipulating
the BINH signal.  Even so, 540 is well below even the initial blanking
interval as programmed into the 6500 module.  There are no obstructions and
I have placed the module facing a wall at 2, 3, 4, and 5 feet with the same
result.  I have repeatedly tested the digital input 7 pin and it tests
normal using the testdigitals() function.  The board does not reset during
the ping event and I can hear an audible clicking when the transducer fires.
The software is waiting for the PD0 high ECHO event because when I
disconnect the jumper from J12 the routines time out and return a -1.  It
appears that the only way this can be happening is if the PD0 input is high
all the time.  But, then it would return even lower numbers, right?

I've checked all connections multiple times.  I've traced the circuits
through the 9 pin ribbon cable for continuity.  Do I still need to install
the .1 (F cap in position C7 on the 6500 board as mentioned in the earlier
pre-expansion board documentation?  Do I need to install the pull-up
resistor?  It looks like the HB has this installed.  After some research I
found other users mentioning a 470 (F cap between two jumpers on the 6500
board.  Based on their notes, this was to protect the 6.270 board from
resetting due to the 2A surge current during the ping event.  I don't see
the reset happening.  Everything works fine after each event, indeed after
several repeated ping events as I am testing using the IC interactive mode.

Anyway, that's the extent of my understanding and the end of my ability to
diagnose and make this system work.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Dear Friends,
	    I had written to you about a rover we are making at VESIT-Bombay
-India.We had encountered some problems regarding downloading the 
pcode_hb.s19 file.I thank you for the advice that you have offered us in 
this context.
	    If we now download the pcode_hb.s19 file, the green LED 
(SER) on the charger/interfacer board and the green LED (PWR) on the 
handyboard both blink visibly.Also, we receive message on main computer 
screen telling that the monitor program,etc has been downloaded. After the 
downloading is over, the green PWR LED remains on.We then restart the board
using a switch present on the board.During this process the PWR LED goes off
and comes on again.We find that the speaker does not beep and the LCD 
welcome message does not appear.Instead we get two rows 
of black squares.
	    Attempts to boot Interactive C fails as it only says
'synchronising with board' and hangs.We have checked all ICs and found
that they have been properly placed in their sockets.No IC gets hot
during this process.
	   The configuration for IC(interactive C) is as follows:
library directory:/ic/lib/
library file:/ic/lib/lib_hb.lis
port:com1

The library directory contains lib_hb.c , .asm , .icb.
	    Can someone tell us what might be the possible solution to this 
problem?
	  Also it was mentioned in the handy board assembly manual that
there was some custom test software being prepared for testing memory.
Is the software ready and from where can it be downloaded?
							Yours Sincerely,
							    Nitin

1) Is there a way to print the actual processor load onto the screen ?
or another way to see for example how much load a program causes ?

2) Does anyone know what resistors i need to produce a voltage divider
to measure the voltage of the battery (using one anolog input) ?

thank you,
Simon

Dear Mr Fred Martin/friends,
		The handy board assembly manual speaks of a custom testing
software needed to test memory. I want it urgently to test memory ICs
used on the handy board to find whether they is working properly. If you
know where it can be found please reply soon.

i am sorry, but i have never readied that software.

to debug, use a logic probe and check all of the 28 pins of the RAM
chip.  address, data, and enable lines should be flashing when the HB
is turned on.  if you see a line stuck at 0 or 1 that might be an
indication of problems.

in my experience it is rarely a failed chip; usually bad wiring or
soldering on the PCB is to blame.

Greetings,
I have assembled my expansion board, mounted on the main board,running IC
v3.1.  
Have downloaded expansion board libraries zip files,unziped and are
inC/:Desktop/IC/ir/libs/encoders/sample/unzipped/hbexplib/expansion-libs.  
    

 I have not been able to load expansion board files.

Do I have to unload any files?
How do I config.  hb_lib.lis ?----ic -config does not work now.
I don't think ic can locate the files. ??

                                                         Thanks in advance

Fred-
      You left it unclear in an explanation to another letter.  You were
answering the fellow from India as to what readings one should see when useing
a logic probe on the memory chip.   You said that if one was stuck at 1 or
zero-it might be indicative of a bad chip.

Should be floating then-around 2.2 volts with power applied?  Both red and
green lights on when useing a logic probe?

Also-I am still having downloading problems-I have had a HB that has always
worked. Now it will not take a DL.  I have replaced all the cables.  I have
ordered a new Maxamchip, & the three memory chips.   Had I not spent the
amount of money I did on the HB to begin with- I would have long ago given up.

yes, memory wires should be oscillating, back and forth betw 0 and 5
volts.  this is not floating; floating implies not connected.

re: your other DL probs, usually, it is a bad connection on the PCB.
try continuity checks on the memory subsystem.  this is about 30 to 40
connections, a bit painstaking, but often it's not a bad chip, but a
bad connection on the PCB.

starting IC,it was saying 'Synchronizing with board' and hanging. I had 
received some replies from the handy board mailing list members telling 
that there might be problem with the memory chip.We replaced the chip and 
found that IC starts.I thank you for your advice.
	We find that there are still some problems with IC.When we start 
IC, it says that _raw_analog function is present in both lib_hb.c as well
as .icb, however it gives the C prompt after showing the error.When we
try to download a IC file it informs us about the double _raw_analog
function and unloads the file.We have found that there is  a different
C file which does not contain _raw_analog function (1998 version).When we
used that C file, it again started giving 'Synchronising with board/board
not responding' message.Sometimes it suddenly tells it is downloading some
bytes and the next message is that board is not responding.
	Whenever we type help or 'list *' commands on the C prompt,they
get executed without error.
	Can somebody tell me,where the latest version of pcode_hb.s19,
lib_hb.* ,ic.exe,dl.exe,hbdl.exe,etc are available?We think the error might
be due to use of incompatible versions of software files.
	Also what do you think the error in the handy board might be?
Is it a software error or is it a hardware error?

Please reply as soon as possible.

Hi Jeremy,

Question:    Do you use 30V  for your Motor ? (external)

IF NO:

I=B4m testing several Motors from copier-machines (12V-24V) with my HB. S=

motors didn=B4t work properly with PWM.

For example    Motor 24V    I=B4m using ist with for 12V Motor (0,100) th=
e
Motor works fine (100=3DFull speed =3D 12V)
                        IF i decrease the speed with PWM (Motor(0,0..100)
the motor didn=B4t have enough torque !!!!

The main problem is, i found out during my tests, a lot of motors with mo=

then 12V don=B4t work properly with PWM,
if you are using lower voltage

yes, you are having lib conflicts.  you should get the latest at

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/software/base.html

the latest has _raw_analog in the .icb file and NOT in the lib_hb.c
file.

re: synchronizing probs, try running IC in a full screen DOS window,
or boot your computer in DOS mode. the freeware IC doesn't run very
well under win 95/98; it's an old DOS program.

A digital port can't have the capability of an analog port, since it has
only one bit of information with which to work.  (A 256-value analog
port has eight bits.)  You could perhaps hook an analog sensor up to a
digital port using some sort of thresholding circuit (a voltage
divider/transistor combination), but you would have to preset the
threshold to a constant value, and the HB would then see it as a digital
device.

Using an analog port as a digital, on the other hand, is easy.

The above will not work (although I don't know what sort of error you
will get).

The above would work ok, although it's a little more terse to say:

     else if( digital( 3 ) ) {...}

It's the same as "if( analog( 3 ) > 127 )".  It basically just throws
away the other seven bits of information.

Note that with an 8-bit D-A convertor circuit, one ought to be able to
use one analog port for up to eight digital inputs at a time.

 Just thought I would add that it *is* possible (if a bit slow) to read an
analog signal w/ a digital port by timing the decay of the signal thru a RC
circuit...not a particularly precise method, either.

Reply-To: tgb@wamnet.com


I ordered the kit the first day I could.  I got it last Friday, and
put it together over the weekend.  The douglas board comes with NO
assembly instrictions! These are some notes that ought to make things
easier for others: 

RP1 & RP2: The both have a dot indicating an origin, the RP1 (1KX4 8
           pin sipp) doesn't matter about the origin.  The RP2 (10X5 6
           pin sipp) the origin must be connected to 5V, so looking at
           the drawing on: 
           (<http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu:80/groups/el/projects/handy-board/hbexp30/>) 
		   the dot should be on the right side.

The male connectors for mating to the HB: Plug them into the HB, and
           tack solder them. Only taks solder them (1 or 2 pins per
           header), the HB doens't need anymore heat. The pins need to
           line up, and if they are lined up before soldering they
           will be more lined up after soldering.  The pins are longer
           than the sockets, so they won't go all the way in.  This is
           ok (and good).

J7 & J11: don't come with the kit. J11 probably will come with the
           polaroid kit.

Good luck,

Dear Mr Fred Martin/friends,
	Thank you for giving the site of the new library files.We started 
IC properly today.It gave NO 'synchronizing with board' errors.
	We input 1 + 2; and it gave the proper result.However when 123 * 2;
was entered at the C> prompt we got the result as 123.We  tried again and 
at the next instance we got the result as 246. Repeated trying gave random 
results varying between 123 and 246.Once it even gave 492 as the result.
	We entered the computation as 123.0 * 2.0;, we got the proper 
answer.
	I want to know whether there is any bug in the software or is it a
hardware mistake?We have written a program to navigate a rover through 
obstacles and in that program we use multiplication of integers.
	Please reply as soon as possible.
							Yours sincerely,
							    Nitin

      I remember the Basic Stamp "POT" command which is used to read the
position of a pot using a digital port.  The Basic Stamps are made from PIC
microcontrollers and the digital ports are bidirectional.  That is they may be
used as digital inputs or digital outputs.  As outputs there are CMOS FETs
pulling the pin to + supply or Ground.  Source or singk is around 20ma.  To
work a POT instruction, you have a POT as a variable resistor in series
between the I/O Pin and a capacitor.  The other end of the capacitor is
connected to ground.  To execute a POT command you would place a logic one on
the port and set the data direction bit for that pin to 0 (output).  You leave
it there for a reletively long to insure that the capacitor is fully charged.
Then you change the data direction register to input and switch the I/O Port
bit value to 0.  You then enter a loop where you switch the data direction bit
to 0 (output) for a microsecond or two, and check the value of the input port
(0 or 1) each time through the loop you increment (or decrement) a counter.
When the port reads 0, you exit the loop and adjust the counter value through
some correction factors gained through a calibration procedure.  As was
mentioned in a previous post, this process is slow, but it will allow some
digital ports to do some analog work.
     With the 68HC11 you have 8 analog ports, and going through all this might
not be the best approach.  You can get "analog switches" (like the CD4066)
which can multiplex the analog ports if you don't have enough analog channels.

Hope this is interesting

i am unable to reproduce the problem.

perhaps comms between IC and your board are still unreliable. 

try writing a program that repeatedly prints to the LCD screen the
result of 123 * 2.  my guess is that it will work perfectly.

also, make sure you have retrieved pcode_hb.s19 directly from the
library web page, and downloaded it into your HB.

Subject: Java on Handy Board?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Handy-folk,

I recently discovered that there is an experimental version of
Java for the 68HC11 microcontroller. Cool! It has been in field 
testing since June, and looks promising. The developers tell me
that a beta version should be released in a few weeks, and that
they are looking for beta testers. The Java VM runs in less than 
6.5k of code memory and less than 100 bytes of data memory. 
There is (limited) support for threads, exceptions, and a native 
interface, along with a package of classes for accessing CPU 
registers, memory and timers. They sent me the documentation, 
and I put it online here: http://www.knowpeace.com/robotics/

Let me know what you think about the possibility of running
Java on the Handy Board. If you are interested (like I am)
in trying this out, please let me know. But be sure to contact 
Peter Gasparick (mailto: peterg@att.net.au) for more info on the 
Java VM implementation. If you do try to get this working on the
Handy board or any 68HC11-based board, please let me know what
your experience is. Also, can anyone tell based on the docs
whether it's feasible to run it on the Hany Board? 

Please note that I am not affiliated with this effort in any 
way, I'm just drooling over the possibilities for future 
robotics software architectures.

Cheers,
Doug

Subject: Battery Level Indicator
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I have been playing around with trying to make a battery indicator on
my Handy Board.  I did find the below diagram from a earlier posting in
March of 98.

     BAT --------R1---------*--------- Analog5 Input

      +ve        (10K)       |             (Active)

                            R2  (4K7)

                             |

                             *--------- Gnd (at Analog5

                                             Connector)

I tried this and it didn't seem to work, although if I changed the
10K and 47K resistor around I manage to get a reading from analog 5.

I was trying to use the battery indicator to check if my robot had hit
an object, although the analog reading only seems to drop 1 point
between
when the motor is running and when it is stalled.  This then makes it 
difficult to determine if the voltage is dropping 'cos the battery is
running out OR the robot has stalled.
I guess my question is, is this a good/bad method to check if the robot 
is stuck?.  I do like this method of testing if the robot is stuck 'cos
I
only have to check one sensor.  Are there other better ways like this???
Any help would be appreicated.......
Cheers

PS
In my playing around I think I have zapped analog(5) as it now reads '0'
when there is no input (OOoouups).  Is it truely dead or can I bring it
back??.

 Ummm, Hi all

     I'm looking for a circuit that will interface a photo transistor or a
photo diode to a digital input. I tried a photocell in an analog port but
it's too slow, I want to use a *visible* light pulse as an accurate
trigger: ie. input triggered when light goes on. I think a transistor or a
diode will be fast enough, but I have no idea how to hook up such a device.
Thresholding won't be a problem as the sensor will be in total darkness
until hit by very bright light. I'm sure this is pretty simple...?

Thanks, Duncan

1.  yes, you probably killed your analog 5.  the analog inputs are
very sensitive to over voltage.  if your ran more than +5v directly
into the input, you probably killed it.

next time you're playing with funky voltages, put a 5K resistor in
series with the funky voltage and the analog input.  that should
protect it.

2.  you can't tell if the robot is stuck by looking at the system
battery, because (as you discovered!) it doesn't drop by much when the
robot is stuck.  one of the properties of nicads is that they can
supply tons of current w/o difficulty.

3.  there is a method to measure the voltage drop across the motor
driver chips.  this is a reasonable way to see if the motor is
stalled.  

this was implemented on the MIT 6.270 board.  see page 200 of the
appendix B document listed at

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/techdocs/

all you have to do is look at the voltage at the point between the
motor LEDs and their 1K drop resistor.  use a 1K resistor between that
point and the analog input.

btw, this only works when you're running the motors at full speed.  if
you are using speed control, the readings get messed up.

When I first got my HC11EVB I ran 12V straight into the E port (one of
the pins), and was sure I ruined the chip.  I called the tech support
person at motorola, and he said 12V on a A/D port should be no
problem.  Sure enough it all still worked.

I think somewhere in the "pink book", it does state that 200% of
reference voltage is ok.

Hi John,

I am interested in your handyboard !

I'm curious, when you say your board only has one motor chip is that
something
you added on or does that mean it only has one of the four outputs for
DC
motors,
that usually comes with the board. Or does that refer to one of two
L293D on the
schematic? s I'm sorry I'm fairly new to this kind of thing so...

Did you put the board together yourself and how old is it?

Thanks for playing 20 questions!

Dear Mr Fred Martin/friends,
	We have run into some strange problems.Whenever we download the 
pcode_hb.s19 to the handy board using dl.exe we first get it is loading 
bootstrap program then the pcode.It shows the loading by a series of dots
and dashes. Does anyone know what the dots and dashes represent? It writes 
'done' after downloading. In one case,I have found that the word done is 
split on two lines- one at the end of one line and other at the beginning
of the next line, in the next case 'done' is at the beginning of one line.
In second case therefore the no of dots are more.Does this mean that the
hb is downloading something less in the first case ?I have seen that in the 
second case the hb always works but in the first case it does not.Does the
no of dots have to do anything with which OS we are using?
	Also after downloading,on reset,the beeper seems to be stuck and it
continuously beeps(in first case where 'done' is on two lines).What is
wrong? 
	There is a 74HC04 chip on the hb.When it is tested on the digital
IC tester it says it is fine but on the hb it does not work.When it in on
the hb the red BATT LED starts glowing for no reason.We noted this when
the handy board was working fine and IC was booting.(ie in the second
case when the hb was working fine and 'done' was on the one line)
	Please reply as soon as possible.We have only few hours to complete 
the rover project. The exhibition for which the project is being prepared
starts at 10:00 tommorow(Indian Standard Time).
							Yours Sincerely,
							    Nitin

I am new to the Handy board and Mine is  in the starting phases of 
construction.  I would like to ask the more experienced roboticist.

1. Why is there a power jack on both the Handy board and the charger?

does the Interface need power? and if there is a power jack on the 
Handy board what is the purpose of the charger?

 2. Do you need high voltage motors(12+volts) or can you use regular 
DC motors the kind that are used to operate childrens toys?

 3. Is Interactive C a nessecity?  A friend was telling me to check 
if you could use a language from other 6811 boards?

We have revised the Handy Board Expansion Board Kit documentation to refer
to the information on the Handy Board website.

Tom Brusehaver is correct in his post that the J11 flex cable connector is
not included in the kit as it is supplied with the Polaroid 6500 Sonar
Imaging System. J7 however, is not a part. J7 refers simply to an open hole
on the PCB that requires no part.

The Handy Board Expansion Board Kit (and Handy Boards and Serial/Interface
Boards) are available from:

this isn't right, so i feel the need to correct you.  the hc11's
analog inputs are sensitive; i have seen many of them destroyed (on a
pin-by-pin basis), and voltages above 5v or below 0v are the cause).

more accurately, it's not the voltage that does the damage, it's the
current, but let's take it one step at a time.

here is the relevant section from the Pink Book, section 12.3:

  "Since there are no P-channel devices directly connected to the A/D
   input or reference pins, voltages above V DD do not pose a latchup
   threat. If an A/D input rises above the threshold of the protection
   device, an input protection device avalanches, and current into this
   device should be limited."

Your tech was probably thinking only of the latchup problem.  the
hc11's analog ins won't latch up with overvoltage, but that doesn't
mean they won't be destroyed.

the key phrase is "current into this device should be limited."  the
over voltage diodes protect against voltages higher than 5v, but these
only work if the over-voltage is current-limited---e.g., in the case
where you have a 5 to 10K resistor in series between the out-of-spec
high voltage and the hc11 analog in.

also, a guaranteed way to blow the pins is to put in a voltage less
than zero volts:

  "Because of an inherent diode to V SS , A/D
   inputs must not go below V SS , or the input can be permanently
   damaged. A series resistor of 1 kW will prevent damage ..."

Here's more if you're interested.  the bottom line is: don't let more
than 25 mA get into the analog input.  Use a 1K to 5K resistor in
series with your "dangerous voltage source" (that is: the signal
you're trying to measure) if there's *ANY* chance that voltage will go
over 5v or under 0v.

Fred

more detail from section 12.3:

  "The minimum-desirable source impedance for an analog input signal
   should ensure the current at the A/D pin never gets high enough to
   cause CMOS latchup. The HC-MOS process used on the MC68HC11A8 is much
   more robust than older 14xxx-style CMOS, but the current at a pin
   should still be limited to 25 mA or less. Although the pins can
   withstand much more, 25 mA is considered a good design target. The
   source impedance that meets this limitation will depend on the total
   system. For example, suppose the worst-case scenario for a particular
   system results in an analog source accidentally shorting to P12 V. The
   inherent internal diodes to V SS will clamp the volt-age at the pin to
   about -0.7 V. This clamped voltage means a maximum current of 25 mA
   must cause 11.3 V to be dropped across a series-limiting resistance,
   which calcu-lates to 452 ohm. However, some guard band should be allowed
   for tolerances on the clamped voltage, the source voltages, the
   resistor, etc."

good beginner questions...

you can use either.  if you use the one on the interface, then power
goes through the phone cable to charge the HB.  if you use the one on
the HB, then power goes through the phone cable to operate the ckts on
the interface.

also, in a pinch, you can run the HB with *no* adapter, since the HB's
battery can power the ckts on the interface.
 
> does the Interface need power?

yes,

having the jack on the HB lets you put it somewhere and keep it
charged w/o using the interface.

>  2. Do you need high voltage motors(12+volts) or can you use regular

the ideal motor is 9v.  hobby toy motors are typically 3v and
specifically do NOT work.  please see the FAQ for more info on motor
compatibility:

no, but why would you want to use anything else :-)?

seriously, IC is extremely beginner-friendly (once you get it
configured and working).  other options are assembly language and
traditional compile-debug-download-crash C compilers.  these do work;
see the "Commercial Software" page.

Dear all,

I looked at the lib_hb file and found the portion for motor outputs.

void motor(int m, int speed)
{
  if (speed>100) speed=100;
  if (speed<-100) speed=-100;
  if (speed >= 0)
    _set_motor(m, 0, (255*speed)/100);
  else
    _set_motor(m, 1, (-255*speed)/100);
}


void _set_motor(int motor, int dir, int speed)
{
    bit_set(0x0e, 1 << (4 + motor));    /* turn motor on */
    if (dir)
    bit_set(0x0e, 1 << motor);  /* set direction for backward */
    else
    bit_clear(0x0e, 1 << motor);    /* set dir for forward */
    _motor_speed[motor]= speed;
    _set_motor_speeds();
}

void _set_motor_speeds()
{
    int speed01= (_motor_speed[0] << 8)
      + _motor_speed[1];
    int speed23= (_motor_speed[2] << 8)
      + _motor_speed[3];

    pokeword(0x22, speed01);
    pokeword(0x24, speed23);
}

Did anyone tried modified it from PVM to constant DC outputs?

Advice please.

Keith

Hello, everyone!

I just joined to Handy Board mailing list and sincerely hope to
exchange useful information and experience to enhance
our daily joy with Handy Board.

 I am considering a kind of intelligent self recharging system of my
robot. When He(or It) get certain low level of power, He looks for
battery charging station of my lab  and move, hit the charging
pole provided large contacts of "+' and "-" and stop and get
charged until certain charge level of power.
In this case, I have to stop my robot when He hit the front bumper
switch against charging pole.
The following basic code doesn't make my robot stop, continuing
of running of left(motor 0) ,right motor(motor 1) even if closing
of bumper switch contact in the front end of my robot.
 Could you please check any error if I get?


void main (void)

  {
      while (digital(7)==0) {   /* digital(7) input: bumper switch
                            connection with normal open contact   */


             printf("Hey, you look for power station?!");

                 fd (0);

                 fd (1);
        }

   }

Thanks.

Dear Friends,
	   Our handy board has developed some problem again.We have put
the 6811 and the RAM chips on the handy board till now. If we download
pcode it downloads it well.On reset beeping does not occur and IC does not
run.What do you think the problem is?Earlier one day the handy board was
working and IC was booting,but now it doesn't do that also.
	  Also if we try putting NOT gate IC (74hc04) on the hb,the red
BATT LED starts glowing for no reason.Do you know what might be wrong?
	Our Exhibition started today,we did not send the rover there as it
was not completed. We would mostly have to do that tomorrow.
	Please reply soon.Thanking you for your reply.
							Yours Sincerely,
							    Nitin

Han ,
    I think you have a slight misunderstanding of the command fd(motor).  This
command means START running the motors, not continue running the motors.
When you hit the switch you need off(motor).  So:
 void main (void)
    {
      fd (0);
      fd (1); 
      printf("Hey, you look for power station?!");
      while (digital(7)==0) {   /* digital(7) input: bumper switch
                             connection with normal open contact   */
 /* Do some steering here */
       }
       off(0);
       off(1);
    }
 
 or in place of off(0) and off(1) you could just call alloff(); which turns
off all motors.  I dont know what you have motors 3 and 4 doing.

hope this helps
Pherd

Hi everyone,

Announcing this year's MIT LEGO Robot Design Competition!  As always,
the contest is open to the general public at no charge, with seating
available on a first-come, first-serve basis.

This year's contest is called "Raiders of the Lost Parts."  Lots of
information about the contest, including the full rule set, is
available at the course home page:
  
  http://web.mit.edu/6.270/www/home.html

The contest is held in MIT lecture hall 26-100.  This is accessible
either from Mass Ave or Vassar Street.  Please refer to the map at
  
  http://whereis.mit.edu/bin/map?locate=bldg_26

If coming from Mass Ave, enter at the dome (Building 7), and walk down
the "Infinite Corridor" (building 7 through 3, 10, 4, then 8), and
turn left and walk through building 16 to reach building 26.  

If coming from Vassar Street, enter through building 34 (which has a
polygonal glass atrium), exit at the left back door, and walk outside
with building 26 on your left and buildings 24 and 12 on your right,
and enter building 26 underneath an overhang.

Or, get in the vicinity and ask a student.

When to arrive:  the room is guaranteed to be filled to capacity, so
the only way to get seating is to arrive early and camp out.  My
advice is to come in a group, arriving by 4:15 (and certainly no later
than 4:45), sit down and send someone out for pizza.  The content
starts at 6 pm.  When seating runs out (usually, by 5:15), there will
be an overflow room with a video feed.

Parking:  street parking is available on Mass Ave, Vassar Street,
Amherst Street, and most side streets.  On the bigger roads it's
metered till 6pm.  In late afternoon, it shouldn't be hard to find a
spot and put enough coins in the meter to last till 6, when parking is
free.


Hope to see you there!

Fred

I understand that you can't use normal toy motors I just have two 
questions:

1. Can you construct circuitry to limit current and voltage draw to 
operate these.

2. Can you purchase 9v motors in the same physical diamensions as 
normal toy motors?

I purchased a motorized bulldozer for my base and It is quite large 
and would make an excellent base and I want to use this for my base
could you please help I wouldn't want to think i wasted my money.

Hello, folks.

My first foray back onto the list in a few years.
 I checked the archives and didn't see an answer to this question,
 so here goes:

Until recently, I taught a freshmen robotics seminar using old
 6.270 boards, motors, and parts bought from past contestants.
 Recently I got some money to move over to 6 new Handy Boards, as the
 old 6.270 boards were unreliable (soldered in a hurry by students
 learning to solder, etc..). In general the Handy Boards are great,
 but I have one big problem:

The motor driver chips (the TI SN75 ones) burn out pretty easily
 when I use the 6.270 motors. I don't know anything about the 6.270
 motors except that they come from Polaroid, but maybe because they
 were originally selected to run off of the 6-volt 6.270 board
 batteries (and through the 1.6 amp 6.270 board motor drivers rather
 than the 1 amp handyboard motor drivers), they draw too much current 
 with the 9-volt handyboard batteries?

I notice that the motor driver chips on the Handyboard are not heat
 sinked in any way. Has anyone had experience heat sinking them?

Has anyone tried stacking TI SN75whatever chips to get a better
 current rating? Do you think this would work?

Does anyone have suggestions for a good place to get other 9-volt 
 motors (and cheaper than the lego motors)?

I'd rather not go to some much more expensive motor driver like the
 LMD18200 ($20 each, and a different pinout)... after buying the Handy
 Boards I don't have too much money left.

thanks for any and all suggestions,

	Too much current (and voltage) for those original
Polaroid motors, which are 6-volt.

	I heat-sink mine with the clip-on variety; it helps.

This works fine.  In fact, piggybacked motor driver chips from
my 6.270 boards work fine in the Handy Board.  In fact, I
was about to suggest to Wanda Gleason that this "hack" be
made a purchasable option.  Of course, since the Handy Board
is designed to be a 1-battery system, if you have motors
which use too much current, the internal battery won't last
long...so in conjunction with this, I have started to
modify my Handy Boards to take an external motor battery
(there is an input jack, you have to cut a trace on the board,
see the Handy Board FAQ for details; I have put a switch
across the cut so I can go back to the all-in-one configuration
if needed).  In general, I prefer the 6.270 battery arrangement:
it's easier to swap in fresh cells and recharge later than have
to wait for the internal battery to recharge--the latter is not
an option in a contest situation where your operating time may
be an hour or more (as we do with our 6.270-based Egg Hunt).
Of course, your mileage may vary.

> Does anyone have suggestions for a good place to get other 9-volt

	If you do the modification to accept an external motor
battery, you can keep using the 6-volt Polaroid motors you have.
I may be looking in the wrong places, but I see more 3-6 V motors
around than 9 V motors.

Hi everyone.  I'm running the HB 1.2 with the expansion board.  I've
installed the 6500 ranging system and use servo ports 1 through 3.  I now
have two wheel encoders functioning and desire to use the IC encoder
routines.

My problem is that I've got the 6500 ranging unit plugged into PA0 and TIC2.
This leaves PA1 and TIC3.  Is TIC1 available somewhere?  Can I assign it to
one of the other digital inputs?  I'm using IC 3.2 and the encoders will run
on PA0 and PA1.  Is there a way to use the Leggo inputs for this?  Has
anyone else done it?

Thanks for your help.

Sure, just hack your HB to use an external battery for the motors.  The
external battery can be whatever voltage the motors prefer (within
reason).  If the motors still draw too much current, try piggybacking
another set of motor driver chips on top of the ones you already have. 
See the FAQ for details.

With the cheaper motors and the modifications suggested above, the
bulldozer ought to run just fine.  The main difference remaining is that
the cheap motors are usually not as efficient as more expensive motors
would be, so you may have to recharge the motor battery more often.  No
big deal!  Good luck.

Dear Fred Martin/friends,
	We have put a total of 6 chips on the handy board-the 6811 ,two
chips placed side by side to the left of the 6811, the fat chip on the
upper side of the 6811, two ICs(chips) one on each side of the fat
chip.(component side) Please mind my language, I have not done the
soldering and hence I don't know the chip nos.
	The pcode_hb.s19 file downloads fine but when we reset the board
the speaker beeps continously and IC does not boot up.
	Please tell me what could be the problem and its solution?
Thanking you,						Yours Sincerely,
							    Nitin

I have bought a Ultrasonic Sensor (with Board) 2 month ago.
Now, to christmas, I got this COOL Handy Board, but I want to use this 
Board with HB on one of these Analog Ports,
but HOW???
I have measured 2 days long (OK, I DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT ELECTRONIC, 
ONLY PC'S) but NOTHING....
Here a have a plan of the board, perhaps someone can do something with 
it... A PICTURE IS THERE AS AN ATTACHMENT

Then i have heared, that you can use HB with an external Batt.
How can i build it? I have not seen Information about it...

I try to build a robot like in this "FIRE FIGHTING ROBOT" thing.(I built 
my own Labirint, because America is far away from GERMANY!!)
But how can my robot know if it is a candle...
I try it with something like that... (NOT REAL IC NOT BASIC NOT PASCAL 
NOTHING!!)

BRIGHT = ANALOG(0)

IF BRIGHT < ANALOG(0) MAKE SOMETHING
IF BRIGHT > ANALOG(0) PUT OUT CANDLE!!

But this does not really work!!!!

has someone an idea?

Thank you...
