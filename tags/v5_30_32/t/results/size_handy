Subject: serial library for C++ 
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hello,
	I have a handy board with poloroid transducers and I am trying use the
results of my distance measurments in a C++ program on the computer.  I
have found programs on the handyboard web page that should alow the
handyboard to transmit information over the serial line.  What I am looking
for is if anyone knows were I could find a serial for Microsofts
Visual C++ 5.0.  I would like to find one that is free or sharware but any
information on any serial that will work would be appreciated.
Thanks.
Mark Wallace
